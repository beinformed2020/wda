A mother's quest for common sense in the pandemic.  

Trapped in lockdown between the two extremes of Coronavirus deniers and lockdown orthodoxy, Nye is intrigued by Sweden’s approach: no lockdown, no school closures, no masks. She manages to secure an exclusive interview with Chief Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, whose steely resolve not to buckle under world mainstream media pressure means – among other things, tango dancing is allowed in Stockholm!   

Claudia Nye is a BAFTA nominated filmmaker.  Brought back to documentaries for the sake of the future of her children, Nye travels from UK to Sweden to learn about their unique Covid-19 strategy.  

She is also a qualified Relationship Counsellor, which she’s been practising over the past ten years. She travelled to Stockholm with photo-journalist Sean Spencer and together they made this documentary.
