> Coronavirus lived on surfaces until it didn’t. Masks didn’t work  until they did, then they did not. There is asymptomatic transmission,  except there isn’t. Lockdowns work to control the virus except they do  not.

Everyone is in danger of the virus except they aren’t. It  spreads in schools except it doesn’t.
