On March 20th 2021, people in over 40 countries across the world gathered  in peaceful unison for a worldwide demonstration - to oppose  disproportionate government measures threatening the very foundation of  their rights and freedoms. This huge international effort was  appallingly misrepresented and downright ignored by the mainstream  media.  

Produced by Oracle Films, in collaboration with CoviLeaks and  independent journalists in over 40 nations – this documentary is an  authentic account of what really happened on March 20th, what protestors worldwide were standing against, and why the media went to such lengths to conceal the truth.  

⁣We received no funding for this project. Since our PayPal was shut  down at the behest of the BBC, we have been asked where people can  donate to us. We are a self-funded collective of professional filmmakers with our own equipment, software and resources. We feel it's important  to emphasise that we are not producing content like this for financial  gain, but simply to inform.
