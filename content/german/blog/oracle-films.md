Welcome viewers of BBC Panorama.  

Despite what the BBC may say about us, we at Oracle Films are not ‘anti-vaxxers’.
Rather we are pro-informed choice. We simply support the preservation of inalienable human rights; the right to freedom of movement, the right to free speech, and the right to bodily autonomy.

Every individual has the right to informed consent, and let it be known that there are thousands of medical professionals around the world that refute the efficacy and safety of this vaccine roll-out.  
We are not against vaccinations and we are not telling people not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. We are simply making people aware that there are two sides to this argument.  

Your government is telling you that you cannot be trusted to make decisions regarding your own health. We do not believe this to be the case, we trust our fellow man to make decisions for themselves. We are all smart enough to make informed decisions.  

Nobody should be denied access to the vaccine, should they want it, but everybody should have the right to information.  

Watch the video for yourself #daretothink
