title: "Mortality Realities Professor Michael Levitt Explains Fully"
draft: false
---

Had an excellent and data-packed convo with Nobel Prize winner and good friend - Professor Michael Levitt of Stanford University!  
It's long-ish but covers all of the crucial excess mortality data from CDC, mortality.org and/or Euromomo databases.  
So ZERO reason for censoring this one, even though the actual governmental data is fascinating!  

Don't ever discuss the data...without actually understanding it. Ever.
