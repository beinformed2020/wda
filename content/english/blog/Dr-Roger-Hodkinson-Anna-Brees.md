His career has spanned general practice, community  hospitals, academia, CEO of a large retail clinical laboratory and  various other entrepreneurial activities in private medicine.  

Dr Hodkinson has a particular interest in molecular diagnostics – the science of identifying DNA for various cutting edge applications in  real world medicine.  

He has spent 20+ years in the trenches of public health as an  activist tackling head-on the biggest public health crisis of our time  before the Covid epidemic, namely the predatory marketing of tobacco and governments reluctance to control it, and for which he was made Citizen of the Year in 1994.
