title: "Lockdowns cause 5x greater harm than any possible benefits, estimates Canadian critical care expert"
draft: false
---

Canadian medical expert Dr. Ari Joffe initially supported lockdowns as a method to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but after doing a [cost-benefit analysis](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/rethinking-lockdowns-cost-benefit-analysis-dr-ari-joffe/) on the government-mandated restrictions he concluded that they are not  justifiable.  

Joffe estimates that the harms caused by lockdown measures  are at least [five to 10 times greater](https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/canadian-experts-research-finds-lockdown-harms-are-10-times-greater-than-benefits) than the benefits, as a population plagued by economic downturn,  unemployment and loneliness is at risk of early mortality, reduced  lifespan and chronic disease.

*Dr. Ari Joffe is a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at  the Stollery Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Edmonton and a Clinical Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at University of Alberta. He has written a paper titled [COVID-19: Rethinking the Lockdown Groupthink](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202010.0330/v2) that finds the harms of lockdowns are 10 times greater than their benefits.*
