Vitamin C is a safe, inexpensive and  highly effective anti-viral nutrient in the right amount, both for  prevention of colds, reducing duration and severity, and for the  treatment of COVID-19 in the acute phase with life-saving potential.   
Yet it is classified as ‘fake information’, not recommended by governments  and rarely prescribed by doctors.   

**This has to change. Sign our petition.**
