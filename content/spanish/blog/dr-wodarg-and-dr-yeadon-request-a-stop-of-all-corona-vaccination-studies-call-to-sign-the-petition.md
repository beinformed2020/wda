On December 1, 2020, the ex-Pfizer head of respiratory research **Dr. Michael Yeadon** and the lung specialist and former head of the public health department **Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg** [filed an application with the EMA](https://2020news.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wodarg_Yeadon_EMA_Petition_Pfizer_Trial_FINAL_01DEC2020_EN_unsigned_with_Exhibits.pdf), the European Medicine Agency responsible for EU-wide drug approval, for the **immediate suspension of all SARS CoV 2 vaccine studies, in particular the  BioNtech/Pfizer study on BNT162b (EudraCT number 2020-002641-42).**

Dr. Wodarg and Dr. Yeadon demand that the studies – for the  protection of the life and health of the volunteers – should not be  continued until a study design is available that is suitable to address  the **significant safety concerns** expressed by an increasing number of renowned scientists against the vaccine and the study design.
