Yet it is classified as ‘fake  information’, not recommended by governments and rarely prescribed by  doctors.  

We are a group of professors, scientists, doctors, nutritionists and  concerned members of the public who want to see people properly informed and protected with vitamin C and other immune defence nutrients and  foods.   

Our mission is to achieve the stated aims of the petition and  thereby protect people, not only from COVID-19 but also from other viral infections.
