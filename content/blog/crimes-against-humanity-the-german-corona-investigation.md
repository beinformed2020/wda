title: "Crimes Against Humanity the German Corona Investigation"
draft: false
---

*The German Corona Investigative Committee has taken testimony from a large number of international scientists and experts since July 10, 2020.*

**Their conclusions are the following:** 

- **The corona crisis must be renamed the “Corona Scandal”**
- It is:
  - The biggest tort case ever
  - The greatest crime against humanity ever committed
- Those responsible must be:
  - **Criminally prosecuted for crimes against humanity**
  - Sued for civil damages
- Deaths
  - There is no excess mortality in any country
  - Corona virus mortality equals seasonal flu
  - 94% of deaths in Bergamo were caused by transferring sick patients to nursing homes where they infected old people with weak immune systems
  - Doctors and hospitals worldwide were paid to declare deceased victims of Covid-19
  - Autopsies showed:
    - Fatalities almost all caused by serious pre-existing conditions
    - Almost all deaths were very old people
    - Sweden (no lockdown) and Britain (strict lockdown) have comparable disease and mortality statistics
  - US states with and without lockdowns have comparable disease and mortality statistics
- Health
  - Hospitals remain empty and some face bankruptcy
  - Populations have T-cell immunity from previous influenza waves
  - Herd immunity needs only 15-25% population infection and is already achieved
  - Only when a person has symptoms can an infection be contagious
- Tests:
  - **Many scientists call this a PCR-test pandemic, not a corona pandemic**
  - **Very healthy and non-infectious people may test positive**
  - **Likelihood of false-positives is 89-94% or near certainty**
  - Prof. Drosten developed his PCR test from an old SARS virus without ever having seen the real Wuhan virus from China
  - The PCR test is not based on scientific facts with respect to infections
  - PCR tests are useless for the detection of infections
  - A positive PCR test does not mean an infection is present or that an intact virus has been found
  - Amplification of samples over 35 cycles is unreliable but WHO recommended 45 cycles
- Illegality:
  - The German government locked down, imposed social-distancing/ mask-wearing on the basis of a single opinion
  - The lockdown was imposed when the virus was already retreating
  - The lockdowns were based on non-existent infections
  - Former president of the German federal constitutional court doubted the constitutionality of the corona measures
  - Former UK supreme court judge Lord Sumption concluded there was no factual basis for panic and no legal basis for corona measures
  - German RKI (CDC equivalent) recommended no autopsies be performed
  - Corona measures have no sufficient factual or legal basis, are unconstitutional and must be repealed immediately
  - No serious scientist gives any validity to the infamous Neil Ferguson’s false computer models warning of millions of deaths
  - **Mainstream media completely failed to report the true facts of the so-called pandemic**
  - Democracy is in danger of being replaced by fascist totalitarian models
  - Drosten (of PCR test), Tedros of WHO, and others have committed crimes against humanity as defined in the International Criminal Code
  - Politicians can avoid going down with the charlatans and criminals by starting the long overdue public scientific discussion
- Conspiracy:
  - **Politicians and mainstream media deliberately drove populations to panic**
  - Children were calculatedly made to feel responsible “for the painful tortured death of their parents and grandparents if they do not follow Corona rules”
  - The hopeless PCR test is used to create fear and not to diagnose
  - There can be no talk of a second wave
- Injury and damage:
  - **Evidence of gigantic health and economic damage to populations**
  - Anti-corona measures have:
    - Killed innumerable people
    - Destroyed countless companies and individuals worldwide
  - Children are being taken away from their parents
  - Children are traumatized en masse
  - **Bankruptcies are expected in small- and medium-sized businesses**
- Redress:
  - A class action lawsuit must be filed in the USA or Canada, with all affected parties worldwide having the opportunity to join
  - Companies and self-employed people must be compensated for damage
