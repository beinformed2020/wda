**Lockdowns** -

The main impact that has occurred with regard to children and young people was the long period of school closures from March until September 2020.  Some pupils (especially those with SEND or classified as vulnerable alongside those whose parents were key worker) were able to attend but this was essentially childminding with little in the way of education.  As an EP I was expected to carry out assessments by phone or purely by summarising others prior reports – no direct work with children or vital cognitive assessments took place.  In short I was expected to write psychological advice with no input from the child in a system that is meant to be child-centred.  In terms of education, remote learning has been proven to be next to useless.  Only very motivated older pupils may have been able to access this.  School is about so much more than learning content – it is about development of social skills, life skills, motor skills and exercise.  Children moving from primary to secondary school had no transition.  Pupils transitioning into college also have no transition.  My workload since September is overwhelming and the level of needs especially in terms of social, emotional and mental health, behavioural and speech and language issues have increased.  These issues are all directly linked to the  governmental choice to close schools and not the virus.

**PCR testing**  

These have been a curse in terms of causing chaos  and disruption to children’s education since September. Every time a  pupil/teacher tests positive (regardless of symptoms) the entire ‘bubble’ (often a whole year group) have to  isolate at home for 2 weeks and its back to virtual learning again. If  there was ever any place to use the lateral flow tests to prevent this  nonsense it should be to enable pupils/staff to remain in school. This has also meant schools struggling to cover  some classes and many TAs have been tasked to do this which is not in  their remit – they are paid very poorly compared to teachers. 

**Facemasks**

These have become more prevalent in schools  unfortunately and staff have been observed teaching young pupils in  visors! Many secondary pupils have been placed in isolation for ‘fiddling’ with or not wearing masks correctly – excluded from education because of masks – unthinkable. 

The impact of all of this on young people is, in my professional  opinion, a crime. Unfortunately, many of my peers continue to believe  that more testing and more school closures is needed. I believe to  counter this nonsense two myths need to be focused upon and exposed:

- Asymptomatic people with positive PCR tests are ‘superspreaders’
- The PCR is a ‘gold standard’ test

 **Lockdowns and related restrictions**
The whole restriction plan of the dutch government makes people scared and paralyzed. They literally stop living. They follow the rules without thinking. A lot of my patients stop going outside, stop social activities, stop exercising, stop working on there immuunsysteem. I have patients who gain 30 kg weight in 6 months; patients who couldn't walk anymore in 3 months because the daycare system stopped and they only stayed in bed or moved a little in there homes; My oncology patients stopped coming for exercises; I have patients with hyperventilation, burnout, depression because of these restrictions. Especially people with high overweight and lung problems; When they finally come to our practice they do there exercises with a mask, they are too scared to take it of. We have all windows open and we tell them that is not good for there health. They are too scared! There are also patients who clean there hands every 30 minutes with the antibacterial gel because they are so scared. I explain of course that Covid is not a bacterie, but they are too scared to change.
The restrictions should stop immediately! That's with I think. All these rules are really bad for our immuunsystem and mental health. We have to work on that in a healthy way by going outside, excersice, socialysing, eating healthy food.

**The PCR test**
I read a lot what scientists have to say about the test. I know about the peer review which has been done in November by Peter Borger and other scientists. So I agree that this test is illegal and I know that our covernment is not listening to these genuine scientists. It seems that they have one goal only and that is mass vaccination. This tests should stop immediately!! And we have to go back to normal!

**Vaccine-safety and testing**
A Vaccine can't be made and be safe in a few months, especially when it is a completely new kind of vaccin!
I don't understand why healthy people should be vaccinated, when the people who died or had to be cured at the IC are mostly older than 70 year and have several severe other health issues. And there is proper medication for this disease! I also think that we already must have group-immunity. So this vaccin is totally unnecessary!
The vaccin is based on de PCR test, but because the PCR test doesn't test specific on Covid; Because the specific covid 19 entity is not found yet. What is this vaccination made for???

**Face masks:**
Are really bad for your immuunsystem!
Don't work for a Virus!
Are really bad for social behavior!
When you take them on and off all day, it is even more begrimed, because they get dirty. It is really stupid to oblige everyone who are healthy to wear a mask. Because wearing it increases the change of getting sick!
Even more stupid: we are forced to wear a NOT working mask!! It is therefor completely useless!! Unless the government want to make the population mass Hysteric; to make them all get a experimental vaccin!! That's in my opinion the only reason why al these rules are obliged.

**Censorship**
On TV there are only guests that agree with the government. People, lawyers, scientists, doctors, nurses and so on who disagree are not invited. Journalists who are working for the normal newspapers stopped doing research. They stopped criticysing! TV, newspapers, radio; they all are propaganda of our government!

**Lockdown and restrictions**

**What didn’t happen:**

The “Hot Sites” that we were planned in my area never happened. We were sent various emails in March asking staff to volunteer for these sites ( they would understand if staff declined due to the high risk of infection) and rotas were drawn up to staff the sites, but-

Nothing happened. There was no rise in acutely unwell patients. Emails stopped being sent with no explanation that the sites weren’t required, nothing more was said about the contingency plans. There has not been a single Hot Site in my area. 

The Nightingale Hospitals weren’t full to capacity. I’m not even aware of the one in Bristol ever being used. 

**What did happen:**

GP surgeries closed their doors. All face to face appointments were stopped. 9 months on, GPs are still only seeing a limited number of face to face patients. The vast majority of consultations are now via Zoom or over the phone. I can’t ever see this changing. 

New CPR guidance advised thinking twice before attempting resuscitation due to potential cross infection and the lack of ITU beds available due to them being filled by Covid patients. I don’t believe this became an issue. 

“Covid related” appeared on nearly all death notifications that the surgery received. What does that actually mean?!

Hospitals cancelled appointments and surgeries. Never in my years of working for the NHS has it ever closed its doors to patients. Chemotherapy was cancelled; people were attending late to see their GP with symptoms of serious disease. We had requests from Paediatricians asking GPs to continue referring children to them as some children were not being seen as early as they should with given illnesses. 

Families were denied access to their dying relatives. I have four friends who lost their fathers’ (not to Covid19). None of them were allowed to be by their bedside at end of life. One friend had to drop her seriously ill father at the door of the hospital before he was wheeled away alone. She was offered a Zoom call to say goodbye to him before he passed away. This is utterly cruel. 

Grandparents were too scared to visit their new-born Grandchildren. I didn’t see my granddaughter for 8 weeks because her mum was so scared of me passing on the virus.
Mothers gave birth alone. 
Mental health issues increased. Loneliness increased. Isolation increased. 
People lost their jobs and businesses. 

**PCR testing**

I have never known a time when a “case” was based on a positive pcr test rather than on how many symptomatic patients there are who need hospitalisation. I believe the WHO changed its definition of a case in 2009. I question their reason behind this. 
Why are healthy people being tested? Since when did a person with no symptoms be considered a potential threat of transmission. 

**Vaccine-safety and testing**

I believe the Pfizer vaccine cannot be declared safe based on the lack of correct testing. It hasn’t gone through animal testing trials and its long term effects aren’t known. It cannot even claim to prevent infection or spread of the virus. Scientists have been trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine for decades with no success. How can a mrna vaccine, that hasn’t been tested on animals, be allowed to be given to the general population? I work with a doctor who will not have the vaccine but is instrumental in setting up vaccination hubs. Where are the ethics here?
People believe that by having the vaccine, society will return to normal. This is perpetuated in the media. It is based on the premise that a pandemic actually exists and that Covid 19 doesn’t discriminate. However, studies have shown that the vast majority of those who develop complications and die from the virus are elderly or have long term conditions. 
I believe the vaccine will become mandatory through shaming and coercion. People may be coerced into having it in order to travel or attend events. 

**Face masks**

Face masks have caused immense psychological and emotional problems. Their use has divided communities and families. They are not being used as they should, ie in sterile operating theatres or when barrier nursing patients, but are used and recycled incorrectly. I don’t believe they should be used in a population that has no symptoms. 
I believe they have created fear and will cause long term psychological problems in children and adolescents. 

**Censorship**

I’m shocked by the censorship within the medical and nursing community. I personally have been asked not to express my views as it reflects badly on my workplace. Challenging such censorship or even asking for honest debate has resulted in people and groups being shamed. I’m aware that doctors and other health workers have lost their jobs through speaking out, and others have to challenge the narrative anonymously. I believe this is a very dangerous precedence for the future of our democracy.

This year at the beginning I had a gut feeling a 6th sense that this  pandemic was wrong & planned. My initial red flag was now that  governments have taken our freedoms, why is this ok & why are we  accepting this?

**Lockdowns:** 

Do nothing for health & will only benefit greed. 
It will increase health issue which has more red flags of corruption.

**PCR test**; 

The science & facts are there for all to see that the PCR test are  being manipulated to serve a agenda of big pharma & socialist  control. 

**Vaccine safety & testing;** 

Why do we need a vaccine for a virus that is 99.8% risk free. 
Why do we not allow treatments available.
Why do we never talk about boosting our own immune system. 
Health should be a choice between you & a health professional. 
Not a government mandate to force something that has corruption & greed all over it. 

**Face mask**; 

This needs to be a free choice.   
The science & facts state that they do zero to protect against a virus, however increase harm to yourself, yet the propaganda is to brainwash  with mind control.   The full cycle is get people sicker with mask, &  fear, get false positive with amplified PCR test get fraudulent vaccine  to make $ & control everyone with socialist take over.   

**Censorship**;

When you produce a fact or assumption against the propaganda & agenda it is censored, this is pure criminal & all need to go to jail today. 
Or give back there billions to humanity..
Once you loose freedom of speech & MSM use lies & one sided agenda propaganda, there is no freedom. 
The bigger picture is this power profit control is not how our consciousness is meant to involve.
We are a light wave energy beings & this blinkered approach to  humanity is like trying to milk a cow with Edward scissor hands. 
There is so much knowledge available & we are being control & used like slaves..

========================================================================

**Lockdowns**: Lockdowns cause tremendous damages in almost all parts of our
societies, so in our economy, social system, cultural field, education, health
system and so on. There’s no benefit at all, because this „pandemie“ is created
by PCR-Tests. Latestely since April 2020, we have the „herd-immunity“, actual we
got it much earlier to all kinds of Corona viruses.

**PCR-Tests**: This is not a test, neather for any virus, nor any infection or any
diagnosis. It is just a way to copy and multiply one little letter and nobody can say
we have found a special long word of 1000 letters, when this particular letter
was found in a mucous membrane. And as I am also a Mathematic teacher, I can
symply calculate the mass of false positive results of this test, even considering
a speicification rate of 99 %. It is criminal always to speak of a detected virus or
an infection after getting a positive PCR-Test.

**Vaccine-safety**: Also this handling is kriminal. Nobody now can claim, that those
new vaccines are safe. We now have huge medical attempt, which is practiced in
so many countries with millions and millions of people, who don’t have the chance
to get sencere information what they are done with and what they get injected in
their body. The health damages perhaps may come months ore years later and
especially the poorer nations and people will have no chance, to get their right. All
the people who now recommend one of those vaccines once should be put to
court.  
**Face-masks:** There is no benefit at all through those things, but there is a lot of
health damages, when you inhale again and again, what the body wants to get rid
of. And it is an ideal climate for all kinds of bacteriums, and doesn‘t protect at all
against getting infected by a virus. The masks are not for health but for showing
your submission under totalitarian measures.  

**Censorship**: In connection with that „pandemie“ we see a tremendous erosion of
our democratic rights and rules, which censorship is one of. But right here it
shows us that the active players of the whole scenario have great fear, that the
truth will come out, that all those lies will be seen through and that their cardhouse
will break down.

======================================================================== 

I have spent 35 years of my professional life to manage various contamination risks throughout the whole Food Chain , in terms of Risk Analysis , Hazards Prevention and control. I was working for Different Food Industry Companies, Farmers and other Major Key players of the Food Business (like Retailers) in France and Abroad .  My last position in the Food Industry was Head of Food Safety in Danone International Babyfood Division. I was representing different Federation of the Food Chain at the EC and French level, as a president of Food Safety and Environment task forces. 

My various responsibilities have led me to be the Head or partner of big labs dedicated to Microcontamination sampling and analysis in  various environment of work : farms, animals, air, workers, factories, many varieties of FoodStuff, equipment etc…. I guess this experience included millions of samples and results..

Accordingly, I can tell that measures of **lockdown** have been proved to be a total nonsense, especially in the light of the most basic epidemy control measures that are currently running for animal diseases. Stopping the spread of virus contamination from  any farm cluster is quasi impossible for common viruses such as FMD or Respiratory viruses, eventhough it is by far easier to lock down a farm, compared to a human population. As an example I was able to find traces of viruses hundred meters from one farm cluster that contaminated another farm. That’s why the only measure that works almost 100% is to slaughter the whole contaminated herd when cows are infected in one farm ! As we use to say : when a wolf enters a sheep pen, locking the sheep pen means locking the wolf with the sheeps (wolf=virus).  

**Masks** : having compared a few times the efficiency of mask protection as a control option for contamination of sensible food like fresh meat or babyfood in factories, I can confirm that wearing mask is not efficient and can even lead to bad hygienic practices of workers, and was also provoking respiratory issues among workers, as compared to Food Processing Labs whith no mask protection. This has been checked with microorganism sampling and analysis, which were not published, for obvious confidentiality reasons. On top of it, wearing a mask during a few hours in a row leads to cultivate some aérobic contaminants (fi staph aureus or pneumococcus) inside the mask itself . Masks are not sterile and it happens to find some pathogenic bacteria in a few batches of masks.  

**PCR testing** : I had many opportunities to use PCR testing for confirming various micro contamination from Foodstuf, Equipment or Air sampling. PCR testing is something usefull when confirming and tracing contamination during investigation « from the farm to the fork », because it helps to trace back the origin of specific contaminants that are present inside a complex flora, at different steps of the food process ,  even when the contaminants are damaged by treatments of the Food Process (Heat for instance). However, using PCR testing for a systematic campaign of screening for checking the presence of one specific strain of bacteria or virus is a waste of time and money, since PCR testing is both too sensitive and never enough specific, regarding the variability of strains, especially viruses, and the probability to have DNA or RNA sequences shared by different variants or strains. That’s why I was forbidding the use of PCR testing for such screening some years ago. In addition, I can confirm that with PCR testing, it is so easy to find positive results for Corona in different samples of air, industrial food stuff, equipment, clothes, etc… either in retailing stores or food factories, despite all the measures currently taken.

- Lockdowns and related restrictions. For me as a nurse it is very strange to lock  up healthy people (98 %). Especially as we know now the virus is no  killer virus. It only effects people who are old and have a weak immune  system ( about 2% of the population) And the most people get ill with no or mild symptoms. The restrictions have major effect on health and  society. So I think it does more harm than good.
- PCR test is not my expertise. I can only say I understood its not meant to  use for any diagnosis. That means the restrictions have no  legal or  medical grounds.
- Vaccine safety and testing: I will not take the vaccine, because in the first  place I am healthy and secondly I don’t believe it is safe. A normal  trail takes more than 5 years to create a “safe” vaccine.
- Face masks: It looks ridiculous and it is ridicule to think it will have any benefit health wise. Luckily I know many shop owners who are relaxed if you don’t wear a mask.
- Censorship: I hear a lot of testimonies of others, but experienced no censorship  myself. All though I feel reluctant to share my own opinion. There is a  kind of tension between people to speak freely about what the feel and  think of the topic.

Social isolation as a consequence  of lockdown or of measures taken against the spread of covid-19, is  likely to cause more morbidity and deaths in older people, other than  those caused by covid-19 itself.   

It is well known that prolonged  social isolation in older people is associated with increased morbidity  and mortality.   
This is due to a combination of lack of physical  exercise, lack of social interaction with friends and family, mental inertness, inadequate supervision for medication,  psychological problems, excesses (alcohol, smoking, drugs), inability to visit the clinic for check-ups and monitoring, unwillingness to visit  hospitals even when there is a serious condition, and many others.   
These reasons may increase the risk of cardiovascular  conditions, dementia, depression, anxiety, falls, sarcopenia and general frailty.   

The risk here is that in our  attempt to protect vulnerable older people in institutions or at home,  we may cause more deaths than those we may prevent.  
It is necessary to  pay more detailed attention to measures against social isolation, rather than simply announce restrictive measures that will certainly result in an increased risk of other diseases.

- **Lockdowns and related restrictions:** It is reasonable to assume that the original lockdowns may have been necessary as the world took. It is striking, however, that for the first time in history, the healthy and not the infected were quarantined. Given that there is no historical basis for this, and indeed the lockdown itself is not an approach with a credible evidence base it has since become perplexing that governments would continue such a policy given the disastrous consequences that ensued. Lockdowns have caused death and misery. One would have thought that, lesson learned, such a policy would not be repeated. To do so, as many governments lamentably have done is nothing short of premeditated murder, and those who have promoted it should face a reckoning in the courts.
- **The PCR test:** The use an inaccurate device which is not fit for purpose according to its inventor, cannot delineate between live and dead viral fragments, and with the significant potential for false positive rates dependant on amplification cycles, has been used to fraudulently cook the statistics to justify the perpetual physiological warfare on the public that is lockdown. Any semblance of an actual pandemic disappeared by May 2020 and since then deaths, which themselves remain questionable – how was diagnoses confirmed for example – have fallen. The definition of a pandemic would imply fatalities significantly above all cause mortality for the time of year. The whole debacle continues to be driven by this fraud. We can fairly access an infection as someone who has symptoms as assessed by a healthcare practitioner, rather than an asymptomatic false positive. Those who promote and have perpetuated this policy should face the courts as soon as possible.  
- **Vaccine-safety and testing:** Simply put there is no emergency and therefore no need to rush a vaccine that nobody needs nor wants. There already exists conventional strategies such as Hydroxychloroquine and zinc, herbal medicine strategies, and nutritional approaches which can help vulnerable persons. A vaccine that has been thoroughly trialled, through long term and independent replication trials, and placebo controlled randomised controlled trials for example using a saline solution rather than another vaccine, may be developed but given the massive conflicts of interest between assorted governments, pharmaceutical interests and Big Tech the current roll-out is clearly an international conspiracy to profit from the misery of others. A disgrace and all persons who have perpetuated this policy should face criminal prosecution as soon as possible.
- **Face masks:** Face masks do not work because they cannot exclude a viral particle which is apparently less than 80 nanometres. Only a solid mask such as the equivalent of a gas mask can do this. The masks are otherwise a health hazard, with the hot and damp atmosphere behind the mask in front of the mouth acting as a magnet for anaerobic bacteria and other infectious agents which have and will cause disease in long term users. Reduced oxygen levels, increased carbon dioxide in the circulation, mask mouth, dental hygiene and the deleterious psychological effects, particularly in the absence of risk assessments which could have been carried out by now, reveals that the purpose of masks is not health but subservience. Those with “exemptions” are persecuted. Those who have put the public at risk by this policy should be held to account.
- **Censorship:** The ongoing use of mass censorship has discredited mainstream media in all its nefarious forms. The complete absence of debate; the callous disregard for science and the hounding of those speaking out and risking their lives and careers is an international disgrace. The public are slowly losing faith in these institutions and they may never recover as a consequence. I certainly hope so. They must face a reckoning for their role in aiding and abetting in this pseudopandemic conspiracy which continues to kill and cause distress for so many innocent people.

I think the Covid19 is the biggest scam ever.  
In South Africa last year 11700 died of normal flu.  
We are now at about 20000 deaths.   
BUT There are no other deaths.  
No TB deaths.  
No co morbidities deaths.  
No heart attacks.   

We have heard that doctors are threatened and bribed to give all deaths  as Covid19.  
I do not accept their treats.

I’ve spent 40 years working in the field of pharmaceutical safety  studies.   
Clinical studies are always bound by the Nuremberg Code of  ethics and the Declaration of Helsinki.  
I believe the UK GOV crossed a  line by circumventing the code which requires long term safety to be  demonstrated by animal testing before a drug is used in humans.   
They are effectively experimenting on the UK population with a completely novel  vaccine.   

Does this amount to treason?
