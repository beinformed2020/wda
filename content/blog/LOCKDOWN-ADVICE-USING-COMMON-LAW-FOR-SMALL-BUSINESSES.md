**WRITE TO GOVERNMENT thus:**

I write to you to put you, the government of the United Kingdom on notice of "conditional acceptance of lockdown" as of today the 3rd Nov 2020.  


I will conditionally accept your demands on proof of the following,  

1) A document that shows and provides scientific evidence of the testing procedure being used in this country that 100% positively identifies Covid19 otherwise known as Sars cov2 not ANY other type of coronavirus in a living being beyond any reasonable doubt.  

2) You can guarantee and prove that the test being used to justify these "guidelines" will not give a false positive result.  

3) Evidence that this is Law, because it clearly says "guidelines".  

4) A copy of the two way contract signed by BOTH parties where I agreed to follow these "guidelines".  

5) The government website clearly states Covid19 is no longer considered a HCID, please provide scientific proof of it being highly contagious.  

6) Please clearly define what you mean by a "public health threat".  

7) Can you confirm the current medical threat to a normal healthy individual (under 75) and confirm how many critically ill healthy people without any underlying conditions (only) there are in ICU so I can make an informed decision on these "guidelines".  

8) What grounds does an alleged "public health threat" which was downgraded in severity levels in March become of higher importance than the long term threat I face in terms of mental and financial ruin?  

9) Are you willing to accept full liability for any/ all financial, physical and/or mental health problems brought on by following this guideline and closing my business?  

10) Please confirm that these guidelines have been through a risk assessment and will protect me from mental and financial ruin.  

11) Please present me with a copy of the "guidelines" and show me where it specifically names my business.  

12) Where there is no victim there is no crime.  

Please explain to me how I am breaking the law by not following these "guidelines" .  
Only a reply that meets the following criteria qualifies as a proper and verfied reply.  


It must be supported by an affidavit with a full legible, title, wet signature, name and address, signed and sworn or affirmed as being true, correct, complete, certain and on full commercial liability and on penalty of perjury.  


Any correspondence must only be sent by registered mail.  


All questions 1-12 MUST be answered clearly.  


If no reply in the correct manner is received within seven (7) days it is thereby taken as your assent and agreement.  

Signed  
Name and full address
