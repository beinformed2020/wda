title: "Take Action Green Pass Requires Debate Not Emergency Adoption"

Dear Member of the European Parliament,  

**Re: Green Pass Requires Debate, Not Emergency Adoption, COM 2021 130**  

We write to oppose the Parliament’s adoption of the “Green Pass” (Digital Green Certificate, introduced March 17, 2021 with  proposal #COM 2021 130) without thorough, vigorous debate. While the  intent of the Green Pass is to facilitate travel during the COVID-19  pandemic, we fear it will do the exact opposite: it will stifle travel  and human interaction.  

We are extremely concerned about the proposed regulation  will affect all travel in the Schengen Zone, for European citizens and  others alike, requiring individuals to prove receipt of an experimental  vaccine or submission to experimental testing.
