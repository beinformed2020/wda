On March 23rd 2020 our country, as directed by the government, entered lockdown in an abrupt turn around of approach to controlling the Covid-19 pandemic, having been advised by the recently resigned Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist from Imperial College, London.  

The need for lockdown was based on speculative death figures generated from a computer model which referenced a simulated pandemic exercise called Event201, a global pandemic exercise.  

This event took place on October 18th 2019 in New York City and was sponsored by the US John Hopkins Centre for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. [ source: www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/ ] NOT www.event201.com  

Professor Ferguson has history in over-inflating the threat level of disease and viruses. Most strikingly, in 2005, he predicted that up to 200 million people could die from the Bird Flu epidemic that broke out in South-East Asia. In the end only 282 people died worldwide from the disease between 2003 and 2009. In 2010 Prof Ferguson was revealed to have close ties with the pharmaceutical industry who made 5-8 billion pounds from 2009 vaccine profits alone.
