As a group of colleagues with over 200 years of combined  experience in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, as well as  long-standing shared interests in developing effective treatments for  critical illnesses including sepsis, we, the [FLCCC Alliance](https://covid19criticalcare.com/about/), formed a working group devoted to creating a treatment protocol against COVID-19 in early March 2020. The protocol we devised, called [MATH+](https://covid19criticalcare.com/math-hospital-treatment/), is intended for use in hospitalized patients, with an emphasis on early initiation—as soon as a patient develops the need for supplemental  oxygen.  

The success of the MATH+ hospital treatment protocol is detailed in the team’s  [Clinical and Scientific Rationale for the MATH+ Hospital Treatment Protocol for COVID-19](https://covid19criticalcare.com/math-plus-rationale-journal-of-intensive-care-medicine-dec2020/) published in the Journal of Intensive Care Medicine in December 2020.  The two hospitals that adopted the MATH+ protocol and initiated it early in the treatment of COVID-19 patients (in ICU) averaged only a 5.1%  mortality rate, compared with mortality rates reported from other  hospitals of between 10–30% during the same time periods, depending on  whether corticosteroids were used. Information about the team’s more  recent I-MASK+ formula for prophylaxis and early outpatient treatment of COVID-19 can be found [here](https://covid19criticalcare.com/i-mask-prophylaxis-treatment-protocol/).
