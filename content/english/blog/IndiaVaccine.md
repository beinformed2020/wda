On January 16, 2021, the Government of India and State governments launched one of the most extensive vaccination drives against COVID-19, targeting 300 million beneficiaries of priority group comprising healthcare workers, frontline workers, and population above 50 years of age.   
The government of India will extend the eligibility to those above 18 years of age on May 1, 2021. Detailed Operational Guidelines are supporting the mass vaccination effort. Further, India has developed a COVID-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) system to track the beneficiaries on a real-time basis.   
The dashboards below visualize daily updates of data from CoWIN for the districts and parliamentary constituencies of India.   
District administrators, elected representatives, policymakers and the public-at-large can use this data to understand how vaccine distribution is progressing and respond effectively.
