title: "Rebuttal Rosemary Frei Bossche Vaccination Concern"
draft: false
---

On March 6, an open letter by Geert Vanden Bossche, Ph.D., DVM, and a video interview of him by Phillip McMillan, MD, from a company called Vejon Health, were posted online.  

On the surface, Vanden Bossche appears to perhaps be addressing credible concerns about COVID.  

He’s saying that the current crop of COVID vaccines will cause the novel coronavirus to mutate into a “super-infectious virus.” And therefore he’s calling for an immediate halt of the use of the current vaccines.  

If humans are “committed to perpetuating our species, we have no choice but to eradicate these highly infectious viral variants” via “large vaccination campaigns,” Vanden Bossche claims at the conclusion of his open letter. However, he continues, in contrast to the currently used COVID vaccines, these new vaccines must focus on stimulation of mass production of the component of the immune system known as natural killer cells, he asserts.  

But Vanden Bossche bases his views on unproven hypotheses. This is similar to, and builds on, high-profile modeling-paper authors who use theoretical frameworks to inflame fears about the supposed dangerousness of the new variants.
