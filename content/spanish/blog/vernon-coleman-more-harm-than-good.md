### Masks and Mask Wearing: 100 Facts You Must Know  

1. 
   Surgeons have been using surgical masks since their introduction in 1897. It has for some
   years been customary for surgeons and nurses to wear surgical masks in the operating theatre
   and to change masks part of the way through any procedure lasting more than a few hours.
   The dangers associated with mask wearing were assessed by five doctors and published in
   the journal Neurocirugia in 2008.  
   Although it is customary for operating theatres to be fitted with air conditioning systems,
   the writers of the article, entitled, Preliminary Report on Surgical Mask induced
   Deoxygenation During Major Surgery, pointed out that it is known that heat and moisture are
   trapped beneath surgical masks and concluded that ‘it seems reasonable that some of the
   exhaled carbon dioxide may also be trapped beneath them, inducing a decrease in blood
   oxygenation’.  
   A total of 53 surgeons, of both sexes, all employed at university hospitals and aged
   between 24 and 54 years of age were tested. All were non-smokers and none had any chronic
   lung disease. The test involved pulse oximetry before and after the course of an operation.
   The study showed that the longer a mask was worn the greater the fall in blood oxygen levels.
   This may lead to the individual passing out and it may also affect natural immunity – thereby
   increasing the risk of infection.  
   The masks used were disposable, sterile, one-way surgical paper masks. To eliminate the
   effect of dehydration over a several hour surgical operation, the surgeons were allowed after
   every hour to drink water through a straw.  
   The authors of the paper concluded that, ‘When the values for oxygen saturation of
   haemoglobin were compared, there were statistically significant differences only between
   preoperational and post operational values. As the duration of the operation increases, oxygen
   saturation of haemoglobin decreases significantly.’

   This quote is taken from New England Journal of Medicine: ‘We know that wearing a mask
   outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health
   authorities define a significant exposure to covid-19 as face to face contact within six feet
   with a patient with symptomatic covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and
   some say more than 10 minutes or even 20 minutes). The chance of catching covid-19 from a
   passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases the desire for
   widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.’ The reference is:
   M.Klompas, C.Morris et al ‘Universal Masking in hospitals in the covid-19 era’ – New
   England Journal of Medicine 2020 

3. 
   It is possible that wearing a mask for hours at a time could cause pulmonary fibrosis. In
   August 1988, the proceedings of the VIIth International Pneumoconioses Conference
   included details of three cases of pulmonary fibrosis, thought to be due to exposure to
   synthetic textile fibres. The first was a woman of 52 who had a dry cough with increasing
   difficulty in breathing. Changes were visible on an X-ray. The woman had been working in a
   textile shop for 15 years where her job was measuring and cutting cloth – mainly synthetic
   materials. The second patient was a woman of 66 who also had difficulty in breathing. The
   lungs of this patient also showed X-ray changes. She was also involved in cutting and
   measuring synthetic fabrics. A third woman, aged 47, had bilateral pulmonary fibrosis.
   Studies have shown that loose fibres are seen on all types of masks and may be inhaled
   causing serious lung damage.

4. 
   People who cough and sneeze into their mask increase the risk of a build-up of fungi and
   bacteria – which can lead to dangerous chest infections.

5. 
   In 2015, the British Medical Journal published a paper entitled, A Cluster Randomised Trial
   of Cloth Masks Compared with Medical Masks in Healthcare Workers. The paper was
   written by nine authors from the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney,
   the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Vietnam and the Beijing Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention in China. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy
   of cloth masks to medical masks in hospital health care workers. The study, which was
   extensive, concluded that the results caution against the use of cloth masks.
   ‘This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety,’ concluded the
   authors. ‘Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased
   risk of infection.’
   And the authors added: ‘...as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be
   recommended for health care workers, particularly in high risk situations, and guidelines need
   to be updated’.

6. 
   Many individuals have turned their masks into fashion items. I wonder how many wear the
   same mask day after day without washing them. If masks are unwashed then they become
   breeding grounds for bacteria, fungi and viruses. If they are washed then they become even
   more useless (if that is possible) than they were when new. The enthusiasm for ‘fashion’
   masks, which match other items of clothing, is rising. But wearing a fashionable mask is akin
   to a slave painting their chains to look pretty.

7. 
   The word ‘covering’ is now often used in official propaganda material, having replaced the
   word ‘mask’. It has clearly been decreed more acceptable than the more usual word ‘mask’
   which carries worrying overtones.

8. 
   It is often difficult to hear what people say when they are wearing masks – particularly if the
   masks are close-fitting. Conversations are kept to a minimum and social interactions in shops
   and other establishments are functional at best. (It is worth noting that hairdressers and others
   in service industries have been instructed to talk as little as possible – ostensibly to prevent
   the spread of the virus. Singing, a joyful activity for singers and listeners, has been banned.)

9. 
   Mask wearers have been encouraged by the psy-op specialists to show their hatred for non-
   mask wearers. This loathsome ploy was first promoted by Ms Dick of the Metropolitan police
   in London, and seems designed to make those who cannot or do not wear masks feel guilty
   and ashamed. The mentally and physically disabled will, therefore, be harassed and abused if
   they dare to go out of their homes.

10. 
    In October 2020, it was noticeable that when street photographs were published in the press
    or online, they invariably showed members of the public wearing masks – even though mask
    wearing out of doors was not compulsory. It was at that point clear that the public would soon
    be forced to wear masks out of doors – even when exercising.

11. 
    Symptoms caused by mask wearing are now being wrongly blamed on covid-19. It seems
    likely that when mask wearing starts to result in deaths (as it will do), those deaths will be
    blamed on covid-19 and used as a reason for politicians and advisors to demand that people
    wear masks for even longer hours. The vicious circle will be complete.

12. 
    The Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the US has decreed that any room
    where the carbon dioxide is present at a level or more than 5,000 parts per million is unsafe
    and has an environment which is toxic and dangerous. Carbon dioxide levels normally exist
    at between 350 and 450 parts per million. Acceptable indoor quality level is 600 to 800 ppm.
    Any employer who attempts to force employees to work in an environment where the carbon
    dioxide level is too high can be held to account. Similarly, any teacher who attempts to force
    children to study in such an environment would be legally responsible. If a nuclear submarine
    has a level of over 5,000 parts per million then it must surface because it is considered to
    have a threatening and dangerous environment. There is much dispute about the levels of
    carbon dioxide which may develop if a mask is worn. Generally, the tighter a mask fits the
    greater the risk that the level of carbon dioxide will rise to dangerous levels but it must be
    remembered that most members of the public have no training on how to wear a mask and
    there are few if any restrictions on mask manufacture. Indeed, members of the public are
    making their own masks and using bits of left over material to do so. A wide variety of masks
    are being designed and worn. Those dismissing the danger as non-existent might like to read
    HSE Contract Research Report no 27/1991, produced by the British Health and Safety
    Executive and entitled, Dead space and inhaled carbon dioxide levels in respiratory
    protective equipment. Those dismissing the risks associated with carbon dioxide levels should
    know that the amount of carbon dioxide in a small room can easily rise to levels which are
    dangerous enough to have a dramatic effect on decision making. At least eight studies in the
    last decade have studied carbon dioxide levels indoors and have found worrying levels above
    1,200 parts per million.

13. 
    Women giving birth in France have to wear face masks. In my opinion, this is dangerous and
    will put extra strain on the heart. Pregnant women should not wear a mask, not only because
    of the risk to themselves but because of the risk to their unborn child. There is a real risk that
    the baby will be stillborn or in some way damaged or poorly developed at birth.

14. 
    A number of those who have studied the science, regard mask wearers as collaborators – who
    will lead us all to damnation if we let them. Their philosophy is: ‘If you’ve got a brain then
    you don’t need a mask’.

15. 
    Research conducted by four French doctors in 2018 and reported in Rev Mal Respir, was
    designed to evaluate the effect of wearing a surgical mask during a six minute walking test.
    The authors of the study were E.Person, C.Lemercier, A.Royer and G.Reychler. (The six
    minutes walking test is regularly used in pulmonology.)
    For this research, 44 health subjects were used. Each individual performed two six minute
    walking tests – one with a mask and one without a mask.
    The researchers found that dyspnoea variation was significantly higher with a surgical
    mask, and concluded that the difference was clinically relevant.
    The conclusion was that ‘wearing a surgical mask modifies significantly and clinically
    dyspnoea.’

16. 
    Vital evidence outlining the dangers and ineffectiveness of mask wearing has been banned,
    blocked or deleted from the internet. Videos assessing the value of face mask wearing on the
    basis of the scientific evidence have been removed. Discussion and debate about the value of
    face masks are suppressed by politicians and the media. Research material outlining the
    dangers of mask wearing has been removed from the internet on the basis that ‘it is no longer
    relevant in our current climate’. So-called ‘fact-checkers’ invariably dismiss medical reports
    published by doctors and scientists – however eminent those experts might be. The so-called
    ‘fact-checkers’ are often linked to commercial organisations or groups with commercial links.
    No one seems to check the ‘fact-checkers’ – though they should.

17. 
    Between 2004 and 2016, at least twelve articles appeared in medical and scientific journals
    showing that face masks do not prevent the transmission of infection.

18. 
    There are no strict rules about what constitutes a face mask, and the rules about when and
    where masks should be worn are constantly changing. This proves that there is no science
    supporting the wearing of masks. So, for example, it is clearly absurd that the coronavirus
    should ever be thought to spread from person to person in a shop but not in an office.

19. 
    The tighter a mask fits the more likely it is to reduce blood oxygen levels and to increase the
    amount of carbon dioxide being inhaled. It should be noted that optimal oxygen intake in
    humans should, according to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration, be
    between 19.5 and 23.5% and that any human-occupied airspace where oxygen measures less
    than 19.5% should be labelled as not safe for workers. However, the percentage of oxygen
    inside a masked airspace generally measures 17.4% within seconds of putting on the mask. A
    tighter fitting mask will result in lower oxygen levels and higher carbon dioxide levels.
    Lower oxygen levels and increased levels of carbon dioxide stimulate greater inspiratory flow
    – leading to a greater risk that loose fibres from the facemask will be inhaled.

20. 
    In Belgium, in September 2020, a group of 70 doctors sent an open letter to Ben Weyts, the
    Flemish Education Minister in which they claimed that children are badly affected by having
    to wear face masks. ‘Mandatory face masks in schools are a major threat to their
    development,’ they wrote. ‘It ignores the essential need of the growing child. The well-being
    of children and young people is highly dependent on emotional attachment to others.’
    (Observing facial expressions help a child’s social development and so seeing those
    around them wearing masks must therefore delay a child’s development.)
    According to The Brussels Times, the doctors continued that ‘there is no large-scale
    evidence that wearing face masks in a non-professional environment has any positive effect
    on the spread of viruses, let alone on general health. Nor is there any legal basis for
    implementing this requirement.’
    ‘Meanwhile, it is clear that healthy children living through covid-19 heal without
    complications as standard and that they subsequently contribute to the protection of their
    fellow human beings by increasing group immunity.’
    ‘The only sensible measure to prevent serious illness and mortality caused by covid-19 is
    to isolate individual teachers and individual children at increased risk,’ they added. ‘This risk
    assessment is not the task of the Ministry of Education but the task of the treating physicians
    in consultation with their patients.’

21. 
    Leading German virologist Professor Streeck has criticised the use of masks, which he has
    said are a wonderful breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. He has also criticised
    lockdowns.

22. 
    Two dentists in New York have reported seeing a number of patients with inflamed gums and
    other problems. The news story was reported in the New York Post.
    ‘We’re seeing inflammation in people’s gums that have been healthy forever, and cavities
    in people who have never had them before,’ said dentist Rob Ramondi. ‘About 50% of our
    patients are being impacted by this, (so) we decided to name it ‘mask mouth’.’
    Another dentist, Marc Sclafani, told the New York Post that ‘gum disease, or periodontal
    disease, will eventually lead to strokes and an increased risk of heart attacks.’
    The dentists said that the problem is caused by the fact that face coverings increase mouth
    dryness and contribute to a build-up of bad bacteria.
    ‘People tend to breathe through their mouth instead of through their nose while wearing a
    mask,’ said Sclafani. ‘The mouth breathing is causing the dry mouth, which leads to a
    decrease in saliva – and saliva is what fights the bacteria and cleanses your teeth.’

23. 
    Masks diminish the quality of our relationships with other people. We trust people less if they
    are wearing masks. We cannot see smiles and so we fear people more.

24. 
    When the truth finally comes out about the dangers of masks, teachers making children wear
    masks in schools will be sued. Bosses making their employees wear masks will also be sued.
    Ignorance is no defence. And as the Nuremburg defendants discovered the reply, ‘I was
    obeying orders’ is no defence.

25. 
    A 26-year-old man suffered a collapsed lung after running 2.5 miles while wearing a face
    mask. Doctors say his condition was caused by the high pressure on the man’s lung, due to
    his intense breathing while wearing the face mask. When masks are made mandatory
    outdoors in the UK, joggers and cyclists will have no choice but to wear masks. Many will
    die.

26. 
    Never in history have so many people worn masks obstructing their intake of air. A
    considerable amount of research has been done into mask wearing. The research shows
    clearly that masks are ineffective in preventing the movement of infective organisms but that
    they reduce oxygen levels and increase levels of carbon dioxide. Most of those advocating
    mask wearing are either ignorant or are deliberately exposing mask wearers to danger for no
    reason. The side effects of excess carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) are headaches, dizziness,
    drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and a tight feeling in the chest. The risks are usually dismissed
    as irrelevant or non-existent by government spokesmen and fact checkers (many of whom are
    sponsored by industry) but I found it impossible to find reliable scientific evidence
    supporting this reassurance. It should be noted that the BBC, which claims to produce fact
    checking material, has financial links to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (which itself
    has strong financial links to the vaccine industry among others) and is in my view entirely
    untrustworthy. The question, as always, is a simple one: who will check the ‘fact checkers’?
    Government defenders regard the removal of a video from YouTube as a sign that the
    advice in the video must have been ‘wrong’. The reality, of course, is the exact opposite since
    YouTube takes down material which disagrees with advice from the World Health
    Organisation which is now heavily sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

27. 
    Streets are littered with discarded face masks which ought to have been incinerated as
    medical waste. If there really were a plague about, I can think of no better way to spread it
    than to litter the country with dirty face masks.

28. 
    In the UK, the rules seem to me to allow anyone to claim a mask wearing exemption if they
    have a physical or mental reason for not wearing a mask or if they feel anxious about wearing
    a mask. And that exemption should not be questioned.

29. 
    Does wearing a face mask reduce your immunity levels? No one seems to know the answer
    for sure but it seems possible that if people wear face masks for long periods (months or
    years) then the absence of contact with the real world might well have a harmful effect on
    immunity – if the face mask works. Do face masks prevent us developing immunity to
    particular diseases? This depends on many factors – mainly the effectiveness of the face
    mask. But if the mask isn’t preventing the development of immunity then it probably isn’t
    worth wearing anyway.

30. 
    Two widely acknowledged hazards of wearing a face mask are first that the mask may give a
    false sense of security and stop people taking other precautions – such as washing their
    hands. Secondly, if masks aren’t worn properly (never touched and changed regularly) they
    can do much more harm than good.

31. 
    There is no doubt that face masks can be dangerous. In China, two school boys who were
    wearing face masks while running on a track both collapsed and died – possibly, I would
    surmise, because the strain on their hearts by the shortage of oxygen proved fatal. At least
    two other deaths due to mask wearing have been reported in Germany.

32. 
    A report published in the British Medical Journal summarised some other risks. First, when
    you wear a face mask some of the air you breathe out goes into your eyes. This can be
    annoying and uncomfortable and if, as a result, you touch your eyes you may infect yourself.
    Second, face masks make breathing more difficult and, as I have already pointed out, anyone
    who has a breathing problem will find that a mask makes it worse. Also, some of the carbon
    dioxide which is breathed out with each exhalation is then breathed in because it is trapped.
    Together these factors may mean that the mask wearer may breathe more frequently or more
    deeply, and if that happens then someone who has the coronavirus may end up breathing
    more of the virus into their lungs. If a mask is contaminated because it has been worn for too
    long then the risks are even greater. How long is too long? No one knows but two hours
    seems an accepted limit. No research has been done as far as I know. Third, there is a risk
    that the accumulation of the virus in the fabric of the mask may increase the amount of the
    virus being breathed in. This might then defeat the body’s immune response and cause an
    increase in infections – other infections, not just the coronavirus.

33. 
    Dr Russell Blaylock, a retired neurosurgeon, has reported that wearing a face mask can
    produce a number of problems varying from headaches to hypercapnia (a condition in which
    excess carbon dioxide accumulates in the body) and that the problems can include life
    threatening complications. Symptoms of hypercapnia include drowsiness, dizziness and
    fatigue. Some of the carbon dioxide exhaled with each breath is retained behind the mask and
    then breathed in again.  
    Dr Blaylock has also warned of neurological problems. ‘By wearing a mask, the exhaled
    viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the
    olfactory nerves and travel into the brain,’ he wrote.  
    And Dr Blaylock has warned of the danger to patients with cancer. ‘People with cancer,
    especially if the cancer has spread, will be at a further risk from prolonged hypoxia as the
    cancer grows best in a microenvironment that is low in oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes
    inflammation which can promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers. Repeated
    episodes of hypoxia have been proposed as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and hence
    increases (the risk of) all cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.’
    34.
    The risk of side effects developing when wearing a mask depend to some extent on whether
    the mask is made of cloth or paper or is an N95 mask filtering out at least 95% of airborne
    particles. One study of 212 healthcare workers showed that a third of them developed
    headaches with 60% needing painkillers to relieve the headache. Some of the headaches were
    thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood or a
    reduction in the amount of oxygen in the blood. Another study, this time of 159 young health
    workers, showed that 81% developed headaches after wearing face masks – so much so that
    their work was affected.
    35.
    An N95 mask can reduce blood oxygenation by as much as 20% and this can lead to a loss of
    consciousness. Naturally, this can be dangerous for vehicle drivers; masked bus drivers, for
    example, could be putting their passengers’ lives at risk.
    36.
    Dr Blaylock has pointed to a study entitled, The use of masks and respirators to prevent
    transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence. This study looked at
    17 separate studies and concluded that none of the studies established a conclusive
    relationship between the use of masks and protection against influenza infection. ‘When a
    person has TB we have them wear a mask,’ concluded Dr Blaylock, ‘not the entire
    community of the non- infected.’
    Dr Blaylock has also described how mask wearing can affect immunity. ‘...a drop in
    oxygen levels (hypoxia) is associated with an impairment in immunity,’ he has written.
    ‘Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight
    viral infections called the CD4+T- lymphocyte. This occurs because the hypoxia increases
    the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor-11 (HIF-11) which inhibits T-
    lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell. This sets the stage for
    contracting any infection, including covid-19, and making the consequences of that infection
    much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased of infections and
    if so, having a much worse outcome.’

37. 
    Visors have one important advantage over masks. The evidence shows clearly that although
    masks are useless at preventing the spread of infection they are potentially extremely
    dangerous. On the other hand, although visors are just as useless as masks at preventing the
    spread of infection they are at least relatively free of danger and are, therefore, the face
    coverings of choice for those who feel the need to wear one. Although they have not been
    tested extensively, visors are probably just as useless as masks but they may be less
    dangerous to wearers. The fact that governments allow citizens to use visors proves beyond
    any shadow of doubt that the whole mask wearing scam is just that – a scam. The aim is to
    obtain psychological control rather than to control disease.

38. 
    Dr Margarite Griesz-Brisson MD PhD is a leading European neurologist and
    neurophysiologist. In October 2020, she warned that rebreathing our exhaled air, because of
    wearing masks, will create oxygen deficiency and an excess of carbon dioxide in the body.
    ‘We know,’ she said, ‘that the human brain is very sensitive to oxygen deprivation. There are
    nerve cells in the hippocampus that cannot last longer than three minutes without oxygen.’ Dr
    Griesz-Brisson pointed out that the acute warning symptoms of oxygen deprivation are
    headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, difficulty in concentration and slowing down of reaction
    times. The real danger is, however, that when the oxygen deprivation becomes chronic, the
    symptoms disappear because the body gets used to them. However, efficiency remains
    impaired and the damage to the brain continues. ‘We know that neurodegenerative disease
    takes years to decades to develop. If today you forget your phone number, the breakdown in
    your brain would have already started two or three decades ago.’  
    Dr Griesz-Brisson explains that while the mask wearer thinks that they are becoming
    accustomed to re-breathing exhaled air, the problems within the brain are growing as the
    oxygen deprivation continues.  
    She also points out that brain cells which die, because of a shortage of oxygen, will never
    be replaced. They are gone for ever. She goes on to argue that everyone is entitled to claim
    exemption from mask wearing because oxygen deprivation is so dangerous – and masks
    don’t work.  
    Finally, Dr Griesz-Brisson points out that children and teenagers must never wear masks,
    partly because they have extremely active and adaptive immune systems but also because
    their brains are especially active and vulnerable. The more active an organ is the more
    oxygen it needs. And so the damage to children’s brains is huge and irreversible.  
    She warns that dementia is going to increase in ten years, and the younger generation will
    not be able to reach their potential because of the mask wearing.  
    Oxygen deprivation adversely affects the heart and the lungs but it also damages the brain.
    And the damage will be permanent.  
    ‘My conclusion has to be that no one has the right to force us to deprive our bodies of
    oxygen for absolutely no good reason. Depriving individuals of oxygen is a crime perpetrated
    by those demanding that we wear masks. Those who let it happen and those who collaborate
    are also guilty. And those who wear masks in situations where they are not legally required
    are cooperating in a criminal activity.’  
    Inevitably, Dr Griesz-Brisson’s interview was removed from YouTube as part of the
    global suppression of medical information.  

39. 
    The nasal flu vaccine, the one given to children, contains attenuated or weakened live viruses.
    It is possible that if a child has a weakened immune system – as would doubtless be the case
    if they’d been imprisoned and kept indoors a lot or had for absolutely no good reason been
    wearing a mask for a long time – then a vaccine virus might conceivably cause the flu. And
    because attenuated viruses aren’t quite dead, they could change or even become live and they
    could mutate and they could result in other people being infected. So it is possible that a child
    who has the nasal flu vaccine could transmit the flu virus to Granny – who might die as a
    result.

40. 
    Many doctors now believe that masks are being used as a conditioning tool to make us more
    compliant. Most people dutifully wear them, wrongly believing that their masks will protect
    them from the coronavirus, and without any idea of the damage that is being done to their
    physical and mental health. All around the world citizens have proved to be extraordinarily
    obedient and gullible, pathetic even, accepting the lies and deceits quite freely. Social
    distancing and the wearing of masks are both likely to be long-term and possibly permanent,
    and the physical and mental damage done is also likely to be long-term and permanent.

41. 
    The rules about mask wearing change from time to time and from one area to another
    (proving that there is no science behind mask wearing) and we never quite know what
    punishments to expect. In one part of America you could be sent to prison for a year if you
    failed to wear a mask. In another part of America you had to pay a 2,000 dollar fine but there
    was no prison sentence. In Texas, some people have been told that they should wear masks in
    their own homes. In one shop a guard pulled a gun on a man who was not wearing a mask.

42. 
    The Chinese wear masks routinely – to protect themselves from pollution. But the masks
    appeared to make no difference to the spread of the coronavirus in China.

43. 
    Economists, professors of anything, engineers, bankers, teachers, company directors and golf
    course management executives are all of one mind: we must all wear our masks.
    Astonishingly, and inexplicably, the media is giving yards of print space and many
    broadcasting hours to these people but denying space or time to experienced, well-qualified
    doctors who simply want to provide truth, scientific evidence and common sense. The few
    doctors who toe the ‘party line’ on the covid-19 hoax are guaranteed huge amounts of
    publicity.

44. 
    Will masks become part of the new world religion (widely known to its supporters as
    Chrislam)? Masks are traditionally associated with a number of repressive rituals.

45. 
    In a paper published in MedRxiv.2020 entitled, Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce
    the spread of respiratory viruses, T.Jefferson, M.Jones et al concluded that compared to not
    wearing a mask there was no reduction of influenza-like illnesses when health care workers
    or the general population wore masks.
    In March 2020, Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer in the UK, warned that it
    is possible to trap the virus in a mask and start breathing it in. She said that wearing a mask
    was not a good idea.

    A meta-analysis published in May in 2020 by the Centers for Disease Control was entitled,
    Non-pharmaceutical measures for pandemic influenza in non-healthcare settings – personal
    protective and environment measures. The authors concluded that the evidence from
    randomized controlled trials of face masks did not support a substantial effect on the
    transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza, either when worn by infected persons or by
    persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility.

47. 
    In May 2016, a meta-analysis written by J.Smith and C.MacDougall and published in the
    Canadian Medical Association Journal concluded that both randomised controlled trials and
    observational studies of N95respirators and surgical masks used by health care workers, did
    not show any benefit against the transmission of acute respiratory infections. The authors also
    concluded that acute respiratory infection transmission may have occurred via the
    contamination of provided respiratory protective equipment during storage and through the
    reuse of masks and respirators during the working day.

48. 
    In 2019, a scientific paper written by L.Radonovich and M.Simberkoff was published in the
    Journal of the American Medical Association. The paper was entitled, N95 respirators vs
    medical masks for preventing influenza among health care personnel: a randomized clinical
    trial. The study involved 2,862 volunteers and showed that both surgical masks and N95
    respirators ‘resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory confirmed
    influenza’.

49. 
    In 2011, a meta-analysis of 17 separate studies regarding masks and the effect on the
    transmission of influenza found that none of the 17 studies established a conclusive
    relationship between mask or respirator use and protection against influenza infection. The
    study was conducted by F bin-Reza, V.Lopez et al. 

50. 
    It was proved in 1920 that cloth masks fail to impede or stop flu virus transmissions. It was
    concluded that the number of layers of fabric required to prevent pathogen penetration would
    require a suffocating number of layers and could not be used. It was also recognised that
    there was a problem of leakage around the edges of cloth masks. 

51. 
    A paper entitled, Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold
    among health workers in Japan: a randomized clinical trial was published in the American
    Journal of Infection Control in June 2009. The authors concluded that face mask use was
    found not to be protective against the common cold when compared to controls who did not
    wear face masks. 

52. 
    In 2009, investigators studied masks for an article published in the Journal of Occupational
    Environmental Hygiene. The authors concluded that for both N95 masks and surgical masks,
    expelled particles were deflected around the edges of the masks and that there was
    measurable penetration of particles through the filter of each mask. 

53. 
    A paper entitled, Face coverings, aerosol dispersion and mitigation of virus transmission
    risk, written by M.Viola, B.Peterson et al, was published in 2005. The authors concluded
    there have been farther transmissions of virus-laden fluid particles from masked individuals
    than from unmasked invididuals, by means of leakage jets, including backward and
    downward jets that may present major hazards. All masks were thought to reduce forward
    airflow by 90% or more over wearing no mask; however Schlieren imaging showed that
    surgical masks and cloth masks resulted in a greater upward airflow past the eyebrows than
    occurred in individuals not wearing masks at all. Backward unfiltered air flow was found to
    be strong with all the masks tested, compared to individuals not wearing masks. In other
    words, if a person wearing a mask has an infection then the risk of being infected is high for
    anyone standing behind the wearer. 

54. 
    A paper by H.Jung and J.Kim, which was entitled, Comparison of filtration efficiency and
    pressure drop in anti-yellow sand masks, quarantine masks, medical masks, general masks
    and handkerchiefs, was published in Aerosol Air Qual Res in June 2013. The paper studied
    44 mask brands and found that the average penetration was 35.6%. Even most medical masks
    had over 20% penetration. Most importantly, the study found that general masks and
    handkerchiefs had no protective function in terms of aerosol filtration efficiency. 

55. 
    A study published in 2015 in the British Medical Journal by C.MacIntyre, H.Seal et al,
    entitled, A cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in
    healthcare workers found that penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% while
    penetration of medical masks was 44%. The authors showed healthcare workers wearing
    cloth masks had significantly higher rates of influenza-like illness after four weeks of using
    masks at work – when compared to controls. 

56. 
    It is widely assumed that surgeons and operating theatre staff must wear masks but a paper by
    N.Mitchell and S.Hunt entitled, Surgical face masks in modern operating rooms – a costly
    and unnecessary ritual which was published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in July
    1991– found no difference in wound infection rates with and without surgical masks. Other
    scientific research papers have established similar conclusions. There was, for example, a
    paper published in 2015 in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine by C DaZhou, P
    Sivathondan et al. The paper was entitled, Unmasking the surgeons: the evidence base behind
    the use of facemasks in surgery. 

57. 
    No one should wear a mask while exercising. There have been several reports of masked
    children dying while exercising. There is evidence showing that mask wearing reduces blood
    oxygen levels even when the wearer is standing still. Individuals who exercise are likely to
    sweat. Masks then become damp more quickly and the damp promotes the growth of
    microorganisms. 

58. 
    S Bae and M.Kim et al published a paper in April 2020 in the journal Annals Internal
    Medicine 2020. The title of their paper was, Effectiveness of surgical and cotton masks in
    blocking SARS CoV 2: A controlled comparison in 4 patients and they concluded that ‘neither
    surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered SARS-CoV-2 during coughs by infected
    patients’. 

59. 
    It is not just out of politeness that surgeons and dentists traditionally remove their masks
    when talking to patients. They do so because they know that patients and relatives find it
    more reassuring, and more comforting, to see a whole human face rather than just part of one.
    Moreover, it is often exceedingly difficult to understand what someone is saying when they
    are wearing a mask. 

60. 
    ‘The face mask traps warm moisture that is produced when we exhale,’ says dermatologist Dr
    Maggie Kober. ‘For those with acne, this can lead to acne flares. For many others, this warm,
    moist environment surrounding skin creates the perfect condition for naturally occurring
    yeast and bacteria to flourish and grow more abundant. This overgrowth of yeast and bacteria
    can produce angular cheilitis, the cracking and sores at the corners of the mouth.’
    Face masks can also present a risk of contact dermatitis and can increase the risk of staph
    infections. 

61. 
    In June 2020, researchers suggested that the oxygen reduction and carbon dioxide build up
    (hypercapnia) might put a considerable strain on the heart, lungs, kidneys and immune
    system. This risk has not been disproven. The paper was written by B.Chandrasekaran,
    S.Fernandes and entitled, Exercise with facemask: are we handling a devil’s sword – a
    physiological hypothesis. 

62. 
    Research has shown that respirators and masks contained influenza bugs found on their outer
    surfaces. The risk was higher the longer the masks were worn. It has also been established
    that bacteria accumulate on masks – and those bacteria can cause lung infections. 

63. 
    Mask wearers are more likely to develop infection than non-mask wearers. This may be due
    to the fact that masks reduce blood oxygen levels and adversely affect natural immunity. It is
    likely that anyone who wears a face mask for long periods will have a damaged immune
    system – and be more susceptible to infection. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit
    immune cells used to fight viral infections. Wearing a mask may make the wearer more likely
    to develop an infection – and if an infection develops it is likely to be worse. Low oxygen
    levels reduce T cells and therefore reduce immunity levels.

64. 
    ‘Is a mask necessary in the operating theatre?’ by N.Orr, published in Annals Royal College
    of Surgeons England in 1981, found no difference in wound infection rates whether or not
    surgeons wore surgical masks.

65. 
    Thousands of years ago, it was discovered that forcing people to wear masks covering much
    of their faces broke their will and made them subservient. The masks depersonalised the
    wearers and dehumanised them too.

66. 
    Dr Scott Atlas, White House coronavirus advisor, claimed that face coverings are not
    effective in stopping the virus’s spread. He tweeted, ‘Masks work? NO’ alongside a link to an
    article that argued against the success of face coverings. Twitter removed his tweet.

67. 
    Children are now demanding to be allowed to wear masks (so that they look ‘grown up’) and
    some are even fitting masks onto their dolls. Parents do not seem aware that children are
    especially vulnerable to the brain damage which will inevitably be a result of the hypoxia that
    is induced by mask wearing.

68. 
    In some parts of the world (particularly parts of the United States of America) it is
    compulsory to wear a mask even while exercising. This is particularly dangerous and will
    lead to a dramatic increase in the number of people dying while exercising.

69. 
    CIA torture techniques include forcing people to remain isolated (as in lockdowns), to keep
    their distance from others (social distancing) and to wear masks.

70. 
    A paper in the journal, Ophthalmology and Therapy (published in September 2020), written
    by Majid Moshirfar, William B. West Jr and Douglas P. Marx warned of an increase in dry
    eye symptoms among mask wearers. Those using masks regularly for extended periods are
    more likely to show symptoms. The condition is caused by exhaled air blowing upwards from
    the mask into the eyes. The increased airflow causes irritation or inflammation. The authors
    conclude ‘this mask-associated ocular irritation raises concerns about eye health and
    increased risk of disease transmission in prolonged mask users’. Their advice is that lubricant
    eye drops should be used and goggles should be worn.
    Dry eyes lead to individuals rubbing their eyes which will lead to an increase in the risk of
    infection.
    Doctors and opticians are also reporting an increase in the number of patients complaining
    of persistent headaches – because of mask wearing. 

71. 
    Those who defend mask wearing claim that the practice must be safe because surgeons and
    operating theatre staff wear masks. But operating theatres have a controlled air temperature,
    masks are replaced every couple of hours, and those working in an operating theatre do not
    rush around doing their shopping. It is important to remember that surgeons who wear masks
    (and not all do) work while standing, rather than walking, and they work in a controlled, air
    conditioned environment. They do not touch their masks and they change them regularly. 

72. 
    We are told that fines for not wearing masks are going up and the military will be brought in
    if the police cannot cope. 

73. 
    Mask wearing is making shopping unpleasant, and thereby destroying thousands of small
    businesses. This is one of the changes in society which will lead to the global reset promoted
    by the United Nations and its Agenda 21 and the World Economic Forum. The plan is to
    force us to live in sterile cities and to do all our shopping online. 

74. 
    Mask wearing, social distancing and testing will become a permanent part of our world. The
    end result will be the permanent closure of schools – and the moving of education online.
    Teachers who insist that pupils wear masks and maintain social distancing rules are
    destroying their own jobs.

75. 
    Fabric masks may allow viruses to enter and are not considered to be anywhere near as
    protective as surgical masks. A study I have seen entitled, Optical microscopic study of
    surface morphology and filtering efficiency of face masks concluded that face masks made of
    cloth are not very good at filtering out viruses because the pores are much bigger than the
    particulate matter that needs to be kept out. One study showed that face masks may have
    pores five thousand times larger than virus particles. If this is accurate it means that the virus
    will wander through the face mask much like a mouse wandering through Marble Arch.

76. 
    The World Health Organisation recommends that disposable masks should be discarded after
    one use. Few people can afford to buy two or more disposable masks for every member of
    their family, and so masks are frequently worn more than once. This massively increases the
    risk of a chest infection developing.

77. 
    Professor Chris Whitty, the UK’s Chief Medical Officer, said in March 2020 that wearing a
    face mask had almost no effect on reducing the risk of contracting covid-19, and that the
    Government did not advise healthy individuals to wear masks. Instead, he suggested that
    people should wash their hands for roughly 20 seconds. 

78. 
    Surgical masks are worn to stop respiratory droplets and human debris from the surgeon or
    nurse from falling into a wound. 

79. 
    Much of the air we breathe in and out, goes around the side of the mask unless it is very tight
    fitting. Loose fitting masks are therefore entirely useless. Tight fitting masks may provide
    some filtration protection but the tighter a mask is the greater the risk of serious hypoxia and
    hypercapnia developing.

80. 
    It is sometimes said that masks should be worn to protect the elderly, the sick and those with
    serious health problems. It would make far more sense to suggest to such individuals that
    they protected themselves from society, if they chose to do so. But they should have the
    choice. And there is absolutely no reason to force younger, healthy members of society to
    endure lockdowns (which will clearly kill far more people than covid-19), social distancing
    (which will create massive psychological problems) or to wear masks (which will do no good
    but which will cause physical and mental health problems).

81. 
    A paper published by Boris Borovoy, Collen Huber and Q.Makeeta investigated all types of
    masks and discovered that ‘loose particulate was seen on each type of mask’. They also noted
    that ‘tight and loose fibres were seen on each type of mask’ and warned that ‘if even a small
    portion of mask fibres is detachable by inspiratory inflow, or if there is debris in mask
    manufacture or packaging or handling, then there is the possibility of not only entry of
    foreign material to the airways but also entry to deep lung tissue, and potential pathological
    consequences of foreign bodies in the lungs’. The authors draw attention to a correlation
    between the inhalation of synthetic fibres and various bronchopulmonary diseases such as
    asthma, alveolitis, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, fibrosis, spontaneous pneumothorax
    and chronic pneumonia. The authors warn that if widespread masking continues, then the
    potential for inhaling mask fibres and environmental and biological debris continues on a
    daily basis for hundreds of millions of people. This should be alarming for physicians and
    epidemiologists knowledgeable in occupational hazards.’ The authors warn that pulmonary
    fibrosis, a risk of mask wearing, cannot be cured and has a 5 to 20 year survival rate of only
    20%. 

82. 
    A mask worn by a child in school was examined in a laboratory. Tests showed 82 bacterial
    colonies and 4 mould colonies growing on the mask.

83. 
    ‘I’m seeing patients that have facial rashes, fungal infections, bacterial infections,’ said Dr
    James Meehan. ‘Reports coming from my colleagues all over the world, are suggesting that
    the bacterial pneumonias are on the rise. Why might that be? Because untrained members of
    the public are wearing medical masks, repeatedly in a non-sterile fashion. They’re becoming
    contaminated. They’re pulling them off their car seat, off the rear-view mirror, out of their
    pocket, from their countertop, and they’re reapplying a mask that should be worn fresh and
    sterile every single time.’ Dr Meehan also reported an incident where one patient wearing a
    mask passed out due to low oxygen while at work and fell off a ladder, resulting in serious
    physical injuries. 

84. 
    If mask wearing were a science, the rules would be constant – but they are not. It is clear,
    therefore, that there is no science behind mask wearing. Citizens are being forced to wear
    masks for political reasons. 

85. 
    It is frequently argued that Sweden, which had no lockdown and no mask requirements, has
    had a very high death rate. If anyone in the media were interested in the facts they would see
    that the average age of Swedish citizens who died was well over 80, and the great majority of
    deaths occurred in care homes and nursing homes. The mortality level in Sweden remained
    below a bad flu season. The Swedish people now seem to have a high, natural immunity. Fact
    checkers around the world might like to look at the Imperial College projections, which were
    alarming, and the actual death rate which was not. Other countries which did not make masks
    compulsory (such as Japan and some African countries) also had relatively low mortality
    rates.

86. 
    A study by M.Walker in 2020 (MedPage Today 2020 May 20) found that 624 out of 714
    people wearing N95 masks left visible gaps when putting on their masks.

87. 
    N95 respirators (or masks) are made with a 0.3 micron filter. Their name comes from the fact
    that 95% of particles having a diameter of 0.3 microns are filtered by the mask.
    Unfortunately, coronaviruses are approximately 0.125 microns in diameter. Still, these masks
    will certainly prevent snowballs, flies and other objects getting through. 

88. 
    T.Tunevall wrote a paper called, Postoperative wound infections and surgical face masks: a
    controlled study which was published in the World Journal Surgery in 1991. The author
    found the use of masks in surgery were found to slightly increase incidence of infection over
    not masking in a study of 3,088 surgeries. The surgeons’ masks were found to give no
    protective effect to the patients.

89. 
    In the UK, if you don’t wear a mask because you have decided you are exempt – and the
    Government says this is a personal choice – the official advice is that you should not
    routinely be required to produce any written evidence to justify the fact that you are not
    wearing a mask. And although I’m no lawyer, I rather doubt that busy bodies, whoever they
    are, have any right to ask you why you have decided that you are exempt. My website
    www.vernoncoleman.com includes a link to a section of the Government website which
    provides an exemption form which can be printed out and attached to a lanyard. 

90. 
    Nine medical authors from Australia and Vietnam studied cloth face masks and concluded
    that cloth masks should not be recommended for health care workers.

91. 
    A meta-analysis published in May 2016 concluded that masks did not have any useful effect
    but that reuse of contaminated masks did transmit infection. Some packs of face masks states
    that masks do not protect the wearer from the coronavirus.

92. 
    There is a risk that viruses may accumulate in the fabric of a mask – thereby increasing the
    amount of the virus being inhaled. 

93. 
    Putting a mask on a baby or an unconscious patient is dangerous. The mask may result in the
    wearer choking on vomit. In my view, masks on babies could increase the risk of sudden
    infant death syndrome. No baby should be forced to wear a mask, and yet there are plenty of
    pictures on the internet showing masks on babies. In some parts of the world, children as
    young as two are forced to wear masks. Small children are more likely than adults to touch
    their masks, thereby rendering them useless. Also, small children are more likely to develop a
    weakened immune system if they wear a mask. Making children wear masks is a form of
    child abuse.  
    ‘It is extremely dangerous to cover a baby’s mouth and nose and the design of ‘cute’ baby
    face coverings that have been brought to our attention look like they would greatly increase
    the risk of suffocation. I would strongly advise parents not to use any form of face covering
    for their baby,’ said Dr Rebecca Fletcher, chair of Bury, Rochdale and Oldham Child Death
    Overview Panel.

94. 
    Some people claim that face masks give them a sore throat, reports Dr Armando Meza an
    infectious disease specialist in Texas. ‘Humidity will let bacteria continue to grow inside the
    mask so if you were growing bacteria in that area and you were breathing that inside, you can
    potentially get an infection, especially strep or any other bacteria that can cause infection.’

95. 
    In some countries, quite small children are forced to wear masks on transport and even in
    schools. The evidence supports the view that politicians, teachers and parents who force (or
    even allow) children to wear masks are guilty of child abuse.

96. 
    A mask can substantially reduce blood oxygenation – leading to a possible loss of
    consciousness. At least one road crash has been blamed on a driver wearing a mask. Police
    reported that the driver of a single car crash in New Jersey, U.S. is believed to have passed
    out behind the wheel after wearing a mask for too long. Passengers would be wise to avoid
    travelling in public service vehicles (buses, coaches, etc.) in which the driver is wearing a
    mask. 

97. 
    Surgeons and nurses are trained never to touch any part of a mask except for the nose bridge
    and the ear loops. If any part of a mask is touched accidentally then the mask is discarded and
    replaced.

98. 
    Over 2,000 Belgian medical professions have urged that covid-19 be prevented by
    strengthening natural immunity. Their recommendations include specifically to exercise in
    fresh air without a mask.

99. 
    A report by Boris Borovoy, Colleen Huber and Maris Crisler reported: ‘Masks have been
    shown through overwhelming clinical evidence to have no effect against transmission of viral
    pathogens. Penetration of cloth masks by viral particles was almost 97% and of surgical
    masks was 44%. Even bacteria, approximately ten times the volume of coronaviruses, have
    been poorly impeded by both cloth masks and disposable surgical masks. After 150 minutes
    of use, more bacteria were emitted through the disposable mask than from the same subject
    unmasked. A paper by these authors entitled, Masks, false safety and real dangers, Part 2:
    Microbial challenges from masks is available on the internet and contains a list of 62
    scientific journal references showing that masks have no significant preventative impact
    against any known pathogenic microbes. These authors conclude, ‘Specifically, regarding
    covid-19, we have shown...that mask use is not correlated with lower death rates nor with
    lower positive PCR tests.’ The authors add that, ‘Masks have also been demonstrated
    historically to contribute to increased infections within the respiratory tract’ and they
    conclude that ‘the use of face masks will contribute to far more morbidity and mortality than
    has occurred due to covid-19.’  

100. 
     There is much more evidence supporting the fact that masks should not be worn. Over a
     dozen scientific papers show clearly that masks are ineffective in preventing the movement of
     infective organisms and/or reduce oxygen levels, and expose wearers to increased levels of
     carbon dioxide. Over a dozen studies failed to show that wearing a mask provides protection
     against infection. In 2011, a meta-analysis of 17 separate studies proved that none of the
     research showed masks to be useful in preventing influenza infection. The available medical
     evidence proves overwhelmingly that masks do no good in preventing the spread of infection
     but do a great deal of harm to those wearing them.   

**Conclusion**  
At no previous time in history have large numbers of people been forced to wear masks. The
long-term physical and psychological consequences are unknown though those ordering that
masks be worn are no doubt aware of the extraordinary risks and of the way that masks can
be used to oppress and subjugate a population. The evidence clearly shows that mask wearing
is likely to do no good but a great deal of harm. The big lie, which the WHO, governments
everywhere and YouTube want to disseminate, is that wearing masks is essential to control
covid-19. But the medical and scientific evidence (banned by YouTube and most mass
media) shows that masks have little or no useful effect but can increase the risk of infection
and can make breathing difficult. There is little doubt that masks do far more harm than good.
Cloth masks are permeable to 97% of viral particles. A study by the University of East
Anglia concluded that wearing masks was of no benefit and could increase infection. Experts
in respiratory disease and infection protection from the University of Illinois have explained
that face masks have no use in everyday life – neither as self-protection nor to protect other
people. A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that neither fabric
masks nor surgical masks can prevent the spread of covid-19 by coughing. An article in the
New England Journal of Medicine, published in May 2020 concluded that masks offer little
or no protection and that the call for masks to be compulsory was an irrational fear reflex. A
German study showed that masks had no effect on infection rates. Dr Fauci, the American
covid-19 supremo, expressed real doubts about masks. On May 28th 2020, he admitted masks
are little more than symbolic. Virtue signalling. A meta study on influenza, published in May
2020 by the CDC in America, found that face masks were of no help. The available evidence
shows clearly that masks do not work but do have the potential to cause a variety of health
problems – including short-term problems such as breathlessness and long-term problems
such as brain damage and death. And yet, despite all this, there have been suggestions from
various authorities that mask wearing and social distancing will need to be permanent. It has
also been suggested that masks should be worn in the home. The sceptical will find it
impossible to avoid the conclusion that there is far more to masks (and compulsory mask
wearing) than meets the eye.  

**Afterword**  
There is absolutely no scientific reason for mask wearing under any circumstances. The
covid-19 hoax is an IQ test. Anyone who wears a mask after studying the evidence has
clearly failed the test.
