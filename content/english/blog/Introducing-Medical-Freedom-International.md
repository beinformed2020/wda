**Medical Freedom International** is an alliance of international groups of medical professionals,  scientists and lawyers from different countries around the world, who  believe that our governments’ responses to COVID-19 are misguided and  are not based upon the best available scientific evidence.   

We aim to combine international resources to educate about the more appropriate scientific evidence and the groups reporting it in the many  different countries across the globe, to challenge the imposition of  unnecessary restrictions on our personal freedoms.  

We encourage like-minded groups of medical professionals and scientists to join **Medical Freedom International** to work with us to help us to amplify the voices of individual organisations and help us achieve our objectives.

**Our Vision**

Our vision is to bring together key medical, scientific and legal groups from around the world to create a platform to reflect and amplify the growing expert opinion that is calling for an end to the damaging and oppressive nature of the measures implemented by our governments.

**Our Focus**

- Requiring fully informed consent for all testing, medical interventions and vaccines.
- Campaigning for the freedom to choose not to accept testing, medical interventions  and vaccines, without penalty or restrictions.
- Educating on the  limitations of the PCR test, which is not a suitable clinical diagnostic tool and should therefore not be used to inform government pandemic  policy.
- Requiring transparency of information. For example, the  intention for the criterion of success of the Covid vaccine trials  merely to be a reduction in moderate symptoms, without considering a  reduction in hospitalisation and death, as well as the use of  non-placebos, such as the meningitis vaccine, as the control in current  trials.
-  Analysing and publicising flaws in the Covid vaccine  trials designs and results. For example, the potential harm of the  vaccine may outweigh the benefit for some people and trials are not  designed to show if severe outcomes such as hospitalisations or deaths  are reduced.
- Calling for research to be undertaken by  independent bodies, not those that stand to gain financially based on a  particular trial outcome.
- Exposing conflicts of interest and  calling for health policies to be formulated by those that do not stand  to gain financially from the use of a product. 
-  Calling for true placebos to be used in vaccine trials.
- Exposing and publicising other COVID-19 inaccuracies, inconsistencies and potential threats to our freedoms and health.
- Educating both Members of Parliament and their scientific and medical advisors on these issues, offering a scientific resource for academics and  journalists and providing a layman’s summary of these resources to be  made available to the public.
