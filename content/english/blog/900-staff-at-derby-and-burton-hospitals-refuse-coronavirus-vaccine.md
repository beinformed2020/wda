900 staff at hospitals in Derby and Burton have refused their Covid-19 vaccinations, for undisclosed or non-health reasons.  

Staff at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust - which oversees the Royal Derby Hospital and Queen's Hospital in Burton - have been prioritised to receive the vaccine since December.
