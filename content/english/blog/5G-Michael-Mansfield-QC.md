title: "ACTION AGAINST 5G with Michael Mansfield QC"
draft: false
---

Michael Mansfield QC is leading our legal team challenging the UK Government  over its failure to take notice of the health risks and public concern  related to 5G.   

One of the most venerated barristers of our time, Michael Mansfield  has led legal teams in high profile cases of civil liberty and  miscarriages of justice. He has represented the families of Grenfell  Tower, Lockerbie, the Ballymurphy Massacre and Stephen Lawrence.   

He was recently described as “the king of human rights work” by The  Legal 500 and as a Leading Silk in civil liberties and human rights.
