[Watch 1986 THE ACT Here](https://1986theact.com)

In 1986, pharmaceutical companies extorted the US Congress into  giving it the best business model in the world: no lawsuits for vaccine  products that are mandated by law to be injected into children -  products that have never been properly tested for safety. Vaccines that  are currently being rushed-to-market for COVID-19 require even less  rigorous testing of their capacity to cause harm. Man and microbe, from  Polio to COVID19 - A dramatic never more relevant forensic examination  of the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act and its consequences.  What happens when an ancient wisdom - a mother's intuition - is pitted  against powerful interests in a race against time?
