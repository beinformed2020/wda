**Liverpool school will also be “barcoding” individuals, and “securing” them should they test positive**

[Original Article Here: Off-Guardian](https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/07/covid19-british-army-to-begin-testing-children-without-parental-consent/)

The Liverpool-based Broadgreen International School is in the  “privileged position” of running a pilot scheme with Public Health  England that will:

- Bring in the military to run Covid19 tests.
- Test children without getting parental consent first.
- Identify each individual with a “unique barcode”.
- “Isolate” and “secure” anyone who tests positive.

It’s all pretty bleak reading. Here is a [link to it on the school website](https://www.broadgreeninternationalschool.com/our-school/important-information-about-coronavirus-covid-19). You can also read the letter here:
