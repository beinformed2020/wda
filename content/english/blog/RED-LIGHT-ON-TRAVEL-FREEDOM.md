Policy documents come think and fast, and the latest from the Government shows us what the thinking is on ‘the safe return of international travel’ some time after 17 May (published before ministers are back from recess of course, no scrutiny here)   

Among the assorted recommendations in the latest report from the Global Travel Taskforce are…  

- Introducing the much-vaunted ‘traffic light’ system with countries graded according to their perceived risk

- Streamlining current working with global organisations such as G7, G20 and Five Eyes (that’s an intelligence alliance comprising the UK, US, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand)

- Stepping up efforts to ensure third party apps can be integrated with a national digital certification system, and…

- Ensuring we can all prove our Covid-19 status through tests and vaccines for outbound travel.
