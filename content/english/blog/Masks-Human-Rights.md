### WITHOUT DISADVANTAGE OR PREJUDICE  
#### NOTICE TO ALL PERSONS ATTEMPTING TO ENFORCE OR REQUEST FACE COVERINGS

**LAW and LEGISLATION are not the same**

Government legislation and mandates are not law, they are advice.  
There is no lawful authority to enforce wearing of masks, tests or medical interventions.  
It is unlawful and discriminatory to require face coverings on entering public premises.  
Denying entry is also unlawful and carries severe penalties for the individual man or woman (acting under orders is no excuse) for harassing someone who has chosen lawful exemption to not wear a face covering which may cause them harm or distress if required to do so.  
A man, woman or child who is not wearing a face covering is not obliged to inform anyone of the reason for their choice, not provide proof of exemption. It is harassment and discriminatory to ask them why or request that they do.   You must assume by their actions and open face that they are lawfully exempt and you must not challenge them.   
You could be fined and get a criminal record.

**Universal Human Rights Still Apply**  

People seem to be under the illusion that because governments are ignoring universal and inalienable human rights, then these no longer apply.
 Nothing could be further from the truth.  
“The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (UDBHR) was accepted unanimously in 2005 by the world community, consisting of 191 member nations.  
This means that the declaration is currently the first and only bioethical text to which the entire world..has committed itself.

### ARTICLE 6 of the UNESCO UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF BIOETHICS & HUMAN RIGHTS 2005:

**Article 6:**
1.	Any [ALL] preventative [FACE MASKS, VACCINES], diagnostic [COVID TESTS] &
therapeutic [GENE THERAPY] medical intervention is only to be carried out with the prior, free
& informed consent of the person concerned based on adequate information. The consent
should, where appropriate, be express and may be withdrawn by the person concerned at any
time and for any reason WITHOUT DISADVANTAGE OR PREJUDICE [YOU CAN’T LOSE YOUR
JOB OR BE PREVENTED ACCESS ANYWHERE]
2.	Scientific research should only be carried out with the prior, free, express and informed
consent of the person concerned. The information should be adequate, provided in a
comprehensible form and should include modalities for withdrawal of consent. Consent
may be withdrawn by the person concerned at any time and for any reason without any
disadvantage or prejudice.

“According to UNESCO, the declaration should be brought to the attention of the community
because knowledge will promote more effective application of its principles. In an attempt to
answer the call of UNESCO, article 6 of the declaration is discussed briefly in this article. It is clear
that the principle outlined in article 6, as a human right, comprises two important components,
namely giving information and giving consent. These two ethical values must always be applied
during medical intervention and research. Where these principles are applied, human autonomy is
confirmed and human dignity is expressed. Although the UDBHR is not judicially enforceable.., its
universal nature offers a clear moral force in the bioethical debate..”
