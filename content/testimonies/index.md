- **Lockdowns and related restrictions:** It is reasonable to assume that the original lockdowns may have been necessary as the world took. It is striking, however, that for the first time in history, the healthy and not the infected were quarantined. Given that there is no historical basis for this, and indeed the lockdown itself is not an approach with a credible evidence base it has since become perplexing that governments would continue such a policy given the disastrous consequences that ensued. Lockdowns have caused death and misery. One would have thought that, lesson learned, such a policy would not be repeated. To do so, as many governments lamentably have done is nothing short of premeditated murder, and those who have promoted it should face a reckoning in the courts.
- **The PCR test:** The use an inaccurate device which is not fit for purpose according to its inventor, cannot delineate between live and dead viral fragments, and with the significant potential for false positive rates dependant on amplification cycles, has been used to fraudulently cook the statistics to justify the perpetual physiological warfare on the public that is lockdown. Any semblance of an actual pandemic disappeared by May 2020 and since then deaths, which themselves remain questionable – how was diagnoses confirmed for example – have fallen. The definition of a pandemic would imply fatalities significantly above all cause mortality for the time of year. The whole debacle continues to be driven by this fraud. We can fairly access an infection as someone who has symptoms as assessed by a healthcare practitioner, rather than an asymptomatic false positive. Those who promote and have perpetuated this policy should face the courts as soon as possible.  
- **Vaccine-safety and testing:** Simply put there is no emergency and therefore no need to rush a vaccine that nobody needs nor wants. There already exists conventional strategies such as Hydroxychloroquine and zinc, herbal medicine strategies, and nutritional approaches which can help vulnerable persons. A vaccine that has been thoroughly trialled, through long term and independent replication trials, and placebo controlled randomised controlled trials for example using a saline solution rather than another vaccine, may be developed but given the massive conflicts of interest between assorted governments, pharmaceutical interests and Big Tech the current roll-out is clearly an international conspiracy to profit from the misery of others. A disgrace and all persons who have perpetuated this policy should face criminal prosecution as soon as possible.
- **Face masks:** Face masks do not work because they cannot exclude a viral particle which is apparently less than 80 nanometres. Only a solid mask such as the equivalent of a gas mask can do this. The masks are otherwise a health hazard, with the hot and damp atmosphere behind the mask in front of the mouth acting as a magnet for anaerobic bacteria and other infectious agents which have and will cause disease in long term users. Reduced oxygen levels, increased carbon dioxide in the circulation, mask mouth, dental hygiene and the deleterious psychological effects, particularly in the absence of risk assessments which could have been carried out by now, reveals that the purpose of masks is not health but subservience. Those with “exemptions” are persecuted. Those who have put the public at risk by this policy should be held to account.
- **Censorship:** The ongoing use of mass censorship has discredited mainstream media in all its nefarious forms. The complete absence of debate; the callous disregard for science and the hounding of those speaking out and risking their lives and careers is an international disgrace. The public are slowly losing faith in these institutions and they may never recover as a consequence. I certainly hope so. They must face a reckoning for their role in aiding and abetting in this pseudopandemic conspiracy which continues to kill and cause distress for so many innocent people.

I think the Covid19 is the biggest scam ever.  
In South Africa last year 11700 died of normal flu.  
We are now at about 20000 deaths.   
BUT There are no other deaths.  
No TB deaths.  
No co morbidities deaths.  
No heart attacks.   

We have heard that doctors are threatened and bribed to give all deaths  as Covid19.  
I do not accept their treats.

I’ve spent 40 years working in the field of pharmaceutical safety  studies.   
Clinical studies are always bound by the Nuremberg Code of  ethics and the Declaration of Helsinki.  
I believe the UK GOV crossed a  line by circumventing the code which requires long term safety to be  demonstrated by animal testing before a drug is used in humans.   
They are effectively experimenting on the UK population with a completely novel  vaccine.   

Does this amount to treason?
