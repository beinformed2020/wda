Continuing with the PCR false positive dilemma... Here’s a quote from a study just published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  
“Viral culture was positive only in samples with a cycle-threshold value of 28.4 or less.”  

[Read here: The New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2027040)  

Researchers could not culture live SARS-COV2 virus from PCR samples with a cycle threshold over 28.4.   

As the PCR test cycles approaches 30 cycles of amplification the likelihood of a false positive increases significantly.   

35 cycles is 10 million times more amplified than 12 cycles (2 to the 12th power vs 2 to the 35th power) and picks up viral fragments as opposed to complete viruses.   

PCR tests have routinely been running up to 45 cycles.   

False positives and overdiagnosis drove the pandemic.   

Overdiagnosis is a big problem in breast, lung and thyroid cancer as well. I cover this in my first book.   

If you test positive on a PCR test, it’s imperative to find out the cycle threshold that was run. Unfortunately most testers have no idea what the labs are doing and most labs aren’t disclosing...  

If you test positive at over 30 cycles with no symptoms, it’s likely that you are not sick and not contagious.   

If you test positive at over 30 cycles WITH symptoms, you still may not be sick from covid-19... Lots of viruses make us sick.   

We need more accurate tests and full transparency on testing methods.   

Facts dispel fear. :)
