They proudly announced that « our analyzes, which had led to a complaint to the  Public Prosecutor’s Office of Rome, after a request for dismissal made  by the Public Minister and with our subsequent opposition last year,  were today considered worthy of further study. **The judge in charge issued AN ORDER in which he indicates to the Public Prosecutor the need to proceed with investigations. **
