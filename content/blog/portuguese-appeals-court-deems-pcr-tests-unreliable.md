title: "Portuguese Appeals Court Deems Pcr Tests Unreliable"
draft: false
---

An appeals court in Portugal has ruled that the PCR process is not a reliable test for Sars-Cov-2, and *therefore any enforced quarantine based on those test results is unlawful*.  
Further, the ruling suggested that any forced quarantine applied to healthy people could be a violation of their fundamental right to liberty.  
Most importantly, the judges ruled that a single positive PCR test cannot be used as an effective diagnosis of infection.
