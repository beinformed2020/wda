**Medical Freedom International** is an alliance of international groups of medical professionals,  scientists and lawyers from different countries around the world, who  believe that our governmentsâ€™ responses to COVID-19 are misguided and  are not based upon the best available scientific evidence.   

We aim to combine international resources to educate about the more appropriate scientific evidence and the groups reporting it in the many  different countries across the globe, to challenge the imposition of  unnecessary restrictions on our personal freedoms.  

We encourage like-minded groups of medical professionals and scientists to join **Medical Freedom International** to work with us to help us to amplify the voices of individual organisations and help us achieve our objectives.
