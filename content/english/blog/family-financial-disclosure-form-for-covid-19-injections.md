title: "Family Financial Disclosure Form for Covid 19 Injections"
draft: false
---

**Introduction**

The goal of this Family Financial Form is to ensure that an adverse  event or death of one family member does not translate into long-lived  or permanent financial destruction for the entire family.  

This form was created to assist families to communicate regarding and to prepare for the family-wide financial impact of adverse events, if  any, resulting from a Covid-19 injection. Examples of adverse events  from Covid-19 injections include Covid-19 infection; anaphylaxis;  neurological disorders; autoimmune disorders; other long-term chronic  diseases; blindness and deafness; infertility, fetal damage,  miscarriage, and stillbirth; and death (see Table 1 for examples of  each).  

Traditionally, informed consent forms for vaccination do not provide  disclosure or statistics related to financial costs of possible injury,  disability, or death, nor do they discuss the impact on family time,  resources, health, and wealth—impacts that may include reduced career  potential, divorce, and effects on siblings’ education and future plans.  

Consequently, it is essential that prior to receiving a Covid-19  injection, parents and family members with financial responsibility for  children and spouses not only perform thorough due diligence—providing  adequate disclosures to their families regarding the potential costs to  family members of adverse events or death—but also take steps to protect themselves and family members from the material adverse financial  consequences of an adverse event or death.
