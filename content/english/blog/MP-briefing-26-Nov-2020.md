**PCR-based COVID testing has failed and is not a proper basis to lockdown the nation, let alone decide on tiers for restrictions.**  
Briefing paper for MPs – 26th November 2020

**The problem**  
Across Europe, including in the UK, we see the following:  

1. Daily “cases” sky-rocketed in Europe as Autumn arrived.
2. Daily deaths labelled as “COVID deaths” rose in line with “cases” – to levels apparently
   higher than at the Spring peak.
3. BUT: Total all-cause mortality does not reflect the above.

**What is behind this conundrum?**
<u>The central thesis of this paper is that we have a major problem with PCR-testing.  
This is distorting policy and creating the illusion that we are in a serious pandemic when in fact we are not.  
This is causing:</u>  

- In the UK a significant proportion of current excess deaths apparently being caused by restricted access to the NHS.
- An NHS staffing crisis which is exacerbating matters.
- Unprecedented assaults on civil liberties and the economy.

<u>What we need to do about this:</u>

- Stop mass-testing using PCR in the UK and replace with Lateral Flow Tests where required. <u>If we are correct, this single measure alone will cause a sudden drop in “cases” (as seen in Liverpool) and allow the UK to return to normal life within weeks.</u>

-  Other recommendations as detailed later in this document.

  It should be noted that legal cases and technical challenges to PCR mass-testing are growing across Europe, including in the UK.  
  NB: The info contained in this paper is merely illustrative of some of the key issues and does not represent the totality of the evidence available.
