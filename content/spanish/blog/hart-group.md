Our core aim is to find the common ground between the Government and  groups that are concerned about COVID-19 restrictions. The ambition is  to bring all sides together and to widen the debate in order to  formulate an exit strategy that benefits everyone in society.  

Our research has identified a need for public policy to reflect a  broader and more balanced approach across a number of key areas, in  particular:  

- Impact of restrictions across the whole of the healthcare system and on wider society; 
- Cost vs benefit of school, college and university closures; 
- The mental health impact of the restrictive measures;
- Mass-testing procedures and associated data analysis; 
- A full assessment of the psychological impact, on individuals and wider society, of COVID-19 communication policies;
- Safe and effective treatment and prevention/prophylaxis options, in addition to vaccination, to increase survival rates. 

Consultations from HART will be founded on scientific, evidence-based principles in the interests of public health. We want to encourage  clear, calm and compassionate discussions.   

Our experts take a collaborative approach and invite contributions  from all sectors and interested groups or communities, at all levels.  

HART is a not-for-profit, unincorporated membership association and  its consulting members collaborate on an entirely voluntary basis.
