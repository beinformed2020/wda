Consumer protection trial lawyer Reiner Fuellmich says agencies 'knowingly misled governments across the world.'  

A group of lawyers is preparing to sue the World Health Organization  and some of its partners for allegedly misleading the world over the  severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the measures taken to control it,  which they say have damaged livelihoods and caused tremendous harm to  economies.  

The move was announced by Dr. Reiner Fuellmich, one of four members  of the German Coronavirus Investigative Committee that has been hearing  international scientists’ and experts’ testimonies since July 10, 2020.  

In a video released to his YouTube channel, Fuellmich accuses WHO  Director Tedros Adhanom, Dr Christan Drosten, the head of virology at  Berlin’s Charité Hospital, and Dr Lothar Wieler, the head of the RKI,  the German counterpart of the U.S. Center for Disease Control, whom he  claims knowingly misled governments across the world.
