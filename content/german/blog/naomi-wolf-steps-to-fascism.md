title: "Naomi Wolf: We’ve Reached ‘Step Ten’ of the 10 Steps to Fascism"
draft: false
---

In her 2008 book, “End of America,” Naomi Wolf outlined the 10 steps  those in power use to close down democracies. Sadly, she writes today,  as governments use the pandemic to justify the suppression of civil  rights, America is now in the throes of “Step Ten.”

In the U.S. we now have:

1.  **Emergency measures in many states**, which suspend  due process of law. This is the hallmark of a police state. COVID-19 is  invoked as the reason for the introduction of emergency law — but there  is no endpoint for lifting these [emergency laws](https://www.postandcourier.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-sc-senate-needs-to-tweak-pass-emergency-powers-law/article_abe56d38-7b9c-11eb-b454-93f03203dd7c.html).
2.  **The closures of schools**, which break the social contract with the next generation.
3.  **Bills being passed for “**[**vaccine passports**](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/global-vaccine-passports-scary-whats-next-2/),” which bypass the [Fourth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/) to the Constitution by allowing the government and [Big Tech](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/big-tech/) companies to intrude on medical privacy, and to create a comprehensive  digital surveillance state. (Indeed, the fact that tech stocks rose by  27% each quarter of the pandemic shows one driver of this war against  the human: Every minute human beings spend in a classroom, at the pub or restaurant or in a church or synagogue, is time that tech companies  lose money by being unable to harvest that data. COVID-19 policies  driven by “COVID-19 Response” — actually, by Big Tech companies — ensure that humans are not allowed to connect except via digital platforms.  The reason is profit as well as social control).
4.  **Forced closures of businesses**. By intervening directly in the economy and allowing certain businesses to flourish ([Amazon](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/make-amazon-pay-open-letter-jeff-bezos/), [Walmart](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/doj-sues-walmart-opioid-crisis/), Target) at the expense of small businesses, Main Street shops,  restaurants and sole proprietor businesses in general, the State has  merged government and corporations in a way that is characteristic of  Italian fascism and modern Chinese communism.
5.  **Restrictions on assembly**. Some states such as  California are fining people for seeing their friends in their homes,  and making it unlawful for kids to have playdates with their friends.  Massachusetts restricted gatherings of more than 10 people at a time,  forcing synagogues and churches to stay closed, in spite of a [Supreme Court ruling](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/06/964822479/supreme-court-rules-against-california-ban-on-in-person-worship-amid-the-pandemi) against states forcing churches to close. Parks and playgrounds and beaches have been closed. In countries such as Britain, [people are fined](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54815307) for leaving their homes for more than an hour’s exercise a day.
6.  **Forced face coverings**. In Massachusetts, people are fined if they are [not wearing masks outdoors](https://www.foxnews.com/us/massachusetts-communities-threaten-fines-of-up-to-1000-for-not-wearing-coronavirus-masks-outside) — even children as young as 5 are forced to do so by law. Again, this  mandate has not been undergirded by peer-reviewed studies showing  medical necessity. And there is no endpoint proffered for these  extraordinary violations of personal freedom.
7.  **Suppression of free speech**. Big Tech companies are [censoring critics](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/robert-kenney-jr-instagram-removal-account/) of COVID-19 policy and vaccine policy, as well as censoring views that  are on the right hand of the political spectrum. Incitement, a word that has a long history in the 20th century for closing down free speech,  has been weaponized by the left to shut down [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) freedoms of expression. In other forms of censorship and management of speech and public debate, tycoons such as [Bill Gates](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/bill-gates-neo-feudalism-farmer-bill/) have been [funding major news outlets](https://www.cjr.org/criticism/gates-foundation-journalism-funding.php), with millions of dollars directed to “COVID-19 education.” As a result, dissenting voices are marginalized and shamed, or even threatened with  legal action or job losses.
8.  **Science being hijacked in the interests of “biofascism**.” By heavily funding scientific commentators such as [Dr. Fauci](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/truth-rfk-jr-david-martin-fauci-moderna-vaccine/) in the United States, Imperial College and SAGE in the U.K. and Dr.  Christian Drosten in Germany, a dominant set of policies and  pronouncements about COVID-19 that benefit a small group of bad actors — notably tech and [pharmaceutical interests](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/big-pharma/), acting in concert with governments — have built an army of secured,  credentialled supporters. But when other scientists or institutions seek debate or transparency, they are threatened with job loss or are  reputationally attacked, as in the case of Dr. Simon Goddeke of the  Netherlands, who was told to keep quiet by his university when he  challenge the [flawed COVID-19 PCR test](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pcr-testing-incorrect-use/) protocols.
9.  **Data being hijacked to serve the interests of this biofascism**. This manipulation of truth, which I foreshadowed in “The End of  America,” is typical of the Soviet censors. COVID-19 platforms such as  the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) and Johns Hopkins University, funded by technocrats such as Michael  Bloomberg, serve unverifiable COVID-19 data that directly affect the  stock markets. Again, while this un-American merger of corporate  interests and public policy is reminiscent of Italian fascism, the twist provided by digital data presentation and its relationship to the stock market is very much of the 21st century.
10.  **Attacks on religious minorities**. The [orthodox Jewish community](https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/gov-cuomo-declines-apology-to-orthodox-jews-over-covid-19-lockdown/) in Brooklyn and Christian churches in California have been singled out  for punishment if they do not follow COVID-19 rules — a targeting of  religion that is characteristic of communist policies on the left,  especially in China.
11.  **Policies that weaken bonds between human beings** and weaken the family being introduced and policed. This is the most serious development of all.
