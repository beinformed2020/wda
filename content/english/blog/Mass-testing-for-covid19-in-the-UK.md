**An unevaluated, underdesigned, and costly mess**

Quick turnaround testing for covid-19 is to be made available to everybody,  initially to those without symptoms, across England at a cost of £100bn  (€110bn; $130bn).[1](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-1) This follows a still uncompleted “pilot” in Liverpool, which started on 6 November at the invitation of Liverpool City Council in October,  after incidence had peaked. The objective is “to demonstrate that  massive asymptomatic testing can help identify far more cases and break  the chain of transmission of coronavirus.”[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-2)

Participation in this pilot is voluntary. There is no call or recall. All  participants receive two tests, the standard PCR test and the rapid  turnaround (within 1 hour) lateral flow Innova test. Those with a  positive result in either test are asked to self-isolate and are  registered with the national track and trace programme, which initiates  contact tracing. Key workers, health and social care staff, school  staff, and children aged 11 and over are being targeted, but anyone can  get tested, preferably at least twice within two weeks.

This is a screening programme, not opportunistic case finding: people are  invited to have a test they would not otherwise have had, or asked for.  If judged against the criteria drawn up by the UK’s National Screening  Committee for appraisal of a programme’s viability, effectiveness, and  appropriateness,[3](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-3) it does not do well and has been already roundly criticised.[4](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-4)

Many asymptomatic people testing positive for covid-19 are probably relatively uninfectious.[5](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-5) Evidence suggests at least a half may develop symptoms[6](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-6) requiring self-isolation without the need for a test. Since few currently adhere to self-isolation,[7](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-7) this is an obvious area for improvement before we embark on an  expensive screening programme. Without a systematic approach to call and recall, those most at risk of being infected and transmitting may be  least likely to present for screening.[8](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-8)

## Potential harms

Despite claims by the city council that the Innova test is “very accurate with high sensitivity and specificity,”[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-2) it has not been evaluated in these conditions. The test’s instructions  for use state that it should not be used on asymptomatic people. A  preliminary evaluation from Porton Down and Oxford University[9](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-9) throws little light on its performance in asymptomatic people or in the field. It suggests the test misses between one in two and one in four  cases. The false positive rate of 0.6% means that at the current  prevalence in Liverpool, for every person found truly positive, at least one other may be wrongly required to self-isolate. As prevalence drops, this will become much worse.

The self-isolation and  tracing of contacts triggered by a positive result can of course be seen as benefiting the individual and others, such as household members. But we know self-isolation has a regressive effect: income level influences adherence to self-isolation[10](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-10) and the likelihood of household transmission.[11](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-11) This underlines the importance of reducing the rate of false positive  results and providing appropriate support—financial, psychological, and  material—to people who must isolate.

Evidence that this  pilot will reduce transmission is not yet established. This makes it  even more critical that it is carefully planned; the different  components, including testing centres, contact tracing, laboratories,  and primary care contributions, are quality assured; its total resource  requirements identified and costed; and the pilot evaluated for cost  effectiveness.

## Shaky ground

With incidence across Liverpool already falling, attributing and quantifying any additional effect from the programme may prove complex. Instead,  similar programmes are being rolled out across the country to  universities and local authorities even before this pilot is complete.

The queues of people seeking tests in Liverpool suggest the initial  acceptability of this pilot is high, at least to some. Its ethical  basis, however, looks shaky. The council claims, wrongly, that the test  detects infectiousness and is accurate. In fact, if used alone it will  lead to many incorrect results with potentially substantial  consequences. The context for gaining consent has been tarnished by the  enthusiasm of some local officials and politicians. In the case of  schools, the programme has been culpably rushed: parents have had to  respond unreasonably promptly to a request to opt out if they do not  want their child screened.[12](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-12)

There is no protocol for this pilot in the public domain, let alone systems  specification or ethical approval. The public has had no chance to  contribute, as required by the UK standards for public involvement in  research.[13](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-13)

Spending the equivalent of 77% of the NHS annual revenue budget on an  unevaluated underdesigned national programme leading to a regressive,  insufficiently supported intervention—in many cases for the wrong  people—cannot be defended. The experience of the National Screening  Committee and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) tells us  that allowing testing programmes to drift into use without the right  system in place leads to a mess, and the more resources invested the  bigger the mess. This system should be designed with up to 10 clear  objectives to deliver the aim of reducing the impact of covid—for  example, to identify cases more quickly or to mitigate the effects of  deprivation on risk of infection and poor outcomes. Progress in each  objective (or lack of it) should be measured against explicit criteria.  Screening programmes based on experience and on the literature relating  to complex adaptive systems[14](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4436#ref-14) offer a model for rapid progress. 

At a minimum, there should be an immediate pause, until the fundamental  building blocks of this mass testing programme have been externally and  independently scrutinised by the National Screening Committee and NIHR.  In the meantime, nobody’s freedom or behaviour should be made contingent on having had a novel rapid test. It is premature to offer testing as  the route to individuals’ release from restrictions. Instead we must  heed the advice of the World Health Organization and the government’s  Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), radically improve the  woeful performance of the “find, test, trace, and isolate” system, and  renew the focus on identifying symptomatic people, especially among  those sections of society most at risk. The current approach will open  Pandora’s box.
