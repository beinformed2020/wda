On 20.1.21, the WHO has changed recommendations on the unreliable PCR test: Now it suddenly states that we skeptics were right all along, that this test produces too many false positive results, with major financial consequences to follow. Now they believe that each person with a positive PCR test should be assessed by a doctor for symptoms and that control tests had to be taken:   

– Then we must be able to claim to obtain 2 new PCR tests, one for a national laboratory and one that we can send to a foreign laboratory for “sequence analysis”, in order to determine whether it is really about SARSCoV2, or influenza.
