Pretoria - The Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, finally issued an  order yesterday allowing for medicine that contained ivermectin as an  active ingredient to also be used for the treatment of Covid-19 if so  prescribed by a doctor.  

This followed a settlement reached between civil rights organisation AfriForum and Pretoria East doctor George  Coetzee in the fight for access to ivermectin.  

Judge Cassim Sardiwalla now formally made the settlement an order of court.  

This followed an agreement that was earlier reached between the applicants  and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority for the  compounding of, and access to, ivermectin.  

This court order  determines that a medicine containing ivermectin as an active ingredient was registered by the regulator in March. The effect of the  registration is that ivermectin may be compounded and made accessible in accordance with the provisions of the Medicines Act.
