draft: false
---

This sit down interview with David  Martin is the longest of our interviews. It has covers more material of  all we have done. It begins with some issues in the patent system. Moves onto the patents surrounding the virus, moves onto documentation of  organizations and concludes with alleged criminal conduct of certain  actors. This is probably the most important interview as far as  documentation and facts in the series.
