**These are the key facts about the Pfizer-Biontech product's assessment under Reg174 at the MRHA:**

- This medicinal product does not have a UK marketing authorisation but has been given authorisation for temporary supply by the UK Department of Health and Social Care
- It has no approval at all for people aged under 16
- The administration of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness
- No interaction or contraindication studies have been performed. In the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products
- No interaction or contraindication studies have been performed. In the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products
- COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy. For women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be excluded before vaccination
- It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is excreted in human milk
- The effects of the vaccine on fertility are unknown

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  
Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/  

**The MHRA was given just five days to study the mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2.   
Hancock called this "the closest scrutiny".**  

Its safety and effectiveness have not been "clearly established".   

The Pfizer product has been given a temporary, narrow approval under the emergency Covid19 legal instruments so eagerly approved by our braindead MPs earlier this year.
