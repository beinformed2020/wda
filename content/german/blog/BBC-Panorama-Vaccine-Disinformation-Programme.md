On 15th Feb 2021 The Tax Funded BBC put out a programme of huge disinformation.

If you disagree with what they said now is your chance to make an offical complaint about this programme - You have to do it in two steps  

STEP 1  
Complaint direct to BBC  
https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaints  

STEP 2  
Once you have complained to the BBC, keep your reference number and use it to upgrade the complaint with Ofcom.

Getting as many complaints as possible with OFCOM is important - if you only complain to the BBC it will stay internal.
