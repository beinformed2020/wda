**Open letter from health professionals and scientists to UK Prime Minister & First Ministers of the 4 Nations.**

[Read here: Us For Them website](https://usforthem.co.uk/first-do-no-harm/)

We the undersigned British health professionals and  scientists, wish to express our serious concern about the current  situation regarding the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The management of the crisis has become disproportionate and is now causing more harm  than good.  

We urge policy makers to remember that this  pandemic, like all pandemics, will eventually pass but the social and  psychological damage that it is causing, risks becoming permanent.  

 We call for restoration of our normal democratic  governance and for politicians to be independently and critically  informed in the decision-making process. After the initial justifiable  response to Covid-19, the evidence base now shows a different picture.  We have the knowledge to enable a policy that protects the elderly and  vulnerable without increasing all other health and economic harms and  which is not at the expense our whole way of life and particularly that  of the nationâ€™s children.
