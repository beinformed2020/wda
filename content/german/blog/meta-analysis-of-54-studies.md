title: "Asymptomatic transmission: Meta Analysis of 54 Studies"
draft: false
---

A meta-analysis of 54 studies looking at infections inside houses where people live together, involving nearly 78,000 participants, found that asymptomatic or presymptomatic index case transmission was 0.7%.  

In other words, 1 asymptomatic person would need to encounter about 140 people INSIDE A HOUSE for them to infect another.  

The chance of infection when in larger areas (e.g., stores) and particularly when outside is probably far less, to the extent that you may need to encounter thousands of people before infecting another.
