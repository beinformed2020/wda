Re: Advertisement, Offer and Administration of Vaccines for COVID-19 in the UK

To All Concerned:  
CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONS REGARDING THE UK’S COVID-19 VACCINE AGENDA  
We are an alliance of medical practitioners, scientists, academics and lawyers who are concerned about the current climate surrounding the impending use of a possible vaccine (“a Covid Vaccine”) that may be advertised, offered and administered among the general public in response to the recent pandemic that has been attributed to a virus called SARS-CoV-2, which we are told causes the symptoms of a disease called COVID-19.  
In this letter we outline our concerns and highlight some of the potential negative outcomes that could arise if these concerns are not taken seriously.  

 We also offer some suggestions for your consideration.  
These practical suggestions may help avert, or alleviate, some of the negative impacts that are likely to result if no action is taken and the current vaccine agenda continues unchecked.

**Overall Conclusion**  
The morbidity and mortality impact on public health from SARS-CoV-2 must be balanced with the risks and costs of a vaccine roll-out.  
We have shown that the mortality and morbidity from SARS-CoV-2 is no longer an existential threat to society.  
It is a huge responsibility to roll out a vaccine manufactured with novel technology.  
 To do so with the intention that all 60+ million people in the UK should receive the vaccine as soon as possible, without full transparency as to potential risks, may be viewed as irresponsible, potentially even negligent, from a legal standpoint.   
We urge you to heed the wisdom in the Hippocratic Oath: “First, do no harm".  
We are confident that the MHRA, JCVI and the DHSC are each aware of their respective duty of care to the UK public and would not wish to take unnecessary risks with our health.   
We therefore expect that you will take our concerns seriously.   
Even in circumstances where the Government has declared a national emergency, we trust that you will make the time to thoroughly digest our letter and the numerous references we have provided.  
In closing, we thank you in advance for allowing us the opportunity to assist and advise you, on behalf of the general public, on these issues of public concern at such an unprecedented time.  

Your sincerely,
