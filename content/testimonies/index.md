**Lockdowns**: Lockdowns cause tremendous damages in almost all parts of our
societies, so in our economy, social system, cultural field, education, health
system and so on. There’s no benefit at all, because this „pandemie“ is created
by PCR-Tests. Latestely since April 2020, we have the „herd-immunity“, actual we
got it much earlier to all kinds of Corona viruses.

**PCR-Tests**: This is not a test, neather for any virus, nor any infection or any
diagnosis. It is just a way to copy and multiply one little letter and nobody can say
we have found a special long word of 1000 letters, when this particular letter
was found in a mucous membrane. And as I am also a Mathematic teacher, I can
symply calculate the mass of false positive results of this test, even considering
a speicification rate of 99 %. It is criminal always to speak of a detected virus or
an infection after getting a positive PCR-Test.

**Vaccine-safety**: Also this handling is kriminal. Nobody now can claim, that those
new vaccines are safe. We now have huge medical attempt, which is practiced in
so many countries with millions and millions of people, who don’t have the chance
to get sencere information what they are done with and what they get injected in
their body. The health damages perhaps may come months ore years later and
especially the poorer nations and people will have no chance, to get their right. All
the people who now recommend one of those vaccines once should be put to
court.  
**Face-masks:** There is no benefit at all through those things, but there is a lot of
health damages, when you inhale again and again, what the body wants to get rid
of. And it is an ideal climate for all kinds of bacteriums, and doesn‘t protect at all
against getting infected by a virus. The masks are not for health but for showing
your submission under totalitarian measures.  

**Censorship**: In connection with that „pandemie“ we see a tremendous erosion of
our democratic rights and rules, which censorship is one of. But right here it
shows us that the active players of the whole scenario have great fear, that the
truth will come out, that all those lies will be seen through and that their cardhouse
will break down.

I have spent 35 years of my professional life to manage various contamination risks throughout the whole Food Chain , in terms of Risk Analysis , Hazards Prevention and control. I was working for Different Food Industry Companies, Farmers and other Major Key players of the Food Business (like Retailers) in France and Abroad .  My last position in the Food Industry was Head of Food Safety in Danone International Babyfood Division. I was representing different Federation of the Food Chain at the EC and French level, as a president of Food Safety and Environment task forces. 

My various responsibilities have led me to be the Head or partner of big labs dedicated to Microcontamination sampling and analysis in  various environment of work : farms, animals, air, workers, factories, many varieties of FoodStuff, equipment etc…. I guess this experience included millions of samples and results..

Accordingly, I can tell that measures of **lockdown** have been proved to be a total nonsense, especially in the light of the most basic epidemy control measures that are currently running for animal diseases. Stopping the spread of virus contamination from  any farm cluster is quasi impossible for common viruses such as FMD or Respiratory viruses, eventhough it is by far easier to lock down a farm, compared to a human population. As an example I was able to find traces of viruses hundred meters from one farm cluster that contaminated another farm. That’s why the only measure that works almost 100% is to slaughter the whole contaminated herd when cows are infected in one farm ! As we use to say : when a wolf enters a sheep pen, locking the sheep pen means locking the wolf with the sheeps (wolf=virus).  

**Masks** : having compared a few times the efficiency of mask protection as a control option for contamination of sensible food like fresh meat or babyfood in factories, I can confirm that wearing mask is not efficient and can even lead to bad hygienic practices of workers, and was also provoking respiratory issues among workers, as compared to Food Processing Labs whith no mask protection. This has been checked with microorganism sampling and analysis, which were not published, for obvious confidentiality reasons. On top of it, wearing a mask during a few hours in a row leads to cultivate some aérobic contaminants (fi staph aureus or pneumococcus) inside the mask itself . Masks are not sterile and it happens to find some pathogenic bacteria in a few batches of masks.  

**PCR testing** : I had many opportunities to use PCR testing for confirming various micro contamination from Foodstuf, Equipment or Air sampling. PCR testing is something usefull when confirming and tracing contamination during investigation « from the farm to the fork », because it helps to trace back the origin of specific contaminants that are present inside a complex flora, at different steps of the food process ,  even when the contaminants are damaged by treatments of the Food Process (Heat for instance). However, using PCR testing for a systematic campaign of screening for checking the presence of one specific strain of bacteria or virus is a waste of time and money, since PCR testing is both too sensitive and never enough specific, regarding the variability of strains, especially viruses, and the probability to have DNA or RNA sequences shared by different variants or strains. That’s why I was forbidding the use of PCR testing for such screening some years ago. In addition, I can confirm that with PCR testing, it is so easy to find positive results for Corona in different samples of air, industrial food stuff, equipment, clothes, etc… either in retailing stores or food factories, despite all the measures currently taken.

- Lockdowns and related restrictions. For me as a nurse it is very strange to lock  up healthy people (98 %). Especially as we know now the virus is no  killer virus. It only effects people who are old and have a weak immune  system ( about 2% of the population) And the most people get ill with no or mild symptoms. The restrictions have major effect on health and  society. So I think it does more harm than good.
- PCR test is not my expertise. I can only say I understood its not meant to  use for any diagnosis. That means the restrictions have no  legal or  medical grounds.
- Vaccine safety and testing: I will not take the vaccine, because in the first  place I am healthy and secondly I don’t believe it is safe. A normal  trail takes more than 5 years to create a “safe” vaccine.
- Face masks: It looks ridiculous and it is ridicule to think it will have any benefit health wise. Luckily I know many shop owners who are relaxed if you don’t wear a mask.
- Censorship: I hear a lot of testimonies of others, but experienced no censorship  myself. All though I feel reluctant to share my own opinion. There is a  kind of tension between people to speak freely about what the feel and  think of the topic.

Social isolation as a consequence  of lockdown or of measures taken against the spread of covid-19, is  likely to cause more morbidity and deaths in older people, other than  those caused by covid-19 itself.   

It is well known that prolonged  social isolation in older people is associated with increased morbidity  and mortality.   
This is due to a combination of lack of physical  exercise, lack of social interaction with friends and family, mental inertness, inadequate supervision for medication,  psychological problems, excesses (alcohol, smoking, drugs), inability to visit the clinic for check-ups and monitoring, unwillingness to visit  hospitals even when there is a serious condition, and many others.   
These reasons may increase the risk of cardiovascular  conditions, dementia, depression, anxiety, falls, sarcopenia and general frailty.   

The risk here is that in our  attempt to protect vulnerable older people in institutions or at home,  we may cause more deaths than those we may prevent.  
It is necessary to  pay more detailed attention to measures against social isolation, rather than simply announce restrictive measures that will certainly result in an increased risk of other diseases.

- **Lockdowns and related restrictions:** It is reasonable to assume that the original lockdowns may have been necessary as the world took. It is striking, however, that for the first time in history, the healthy and not the infected were quarantined. Given that there is no historical basis for this, and indeed the lockdown itself is not an approach with a credible evidence base it has since become perplexing that governments would continue such a policy given the disastrous consequences that ensued. Lockdowns have caused death and misery. One would have thought that, lesson learned, such a policy would not be repeated. To do so, as many governments lamentably have done is nothing short of premeditated murder, and those who have promoted it should face a reckoning in the courts.
- **The PCR test:** The use an inaccurate device which is not fit for purpose according to its inventor, cannot delineate between live and dead viral fragments, and with the significant potential for false positive rates dependant on amplification cycles, has been used to fraudulently cook the statistics to justify the perpetual physiological warfare on the public that is lockdown. Any semblance of an actual pandemic disappeared by May 2020 and since then deaths, which themselves remain questionable – how was diagnoses confirmed for example – have fallen. The definition of a pandemic would imply fatalities significantly above all cause mortality for the time of year. The whole debacle continues to be driven by this fraud. We can fairly access an infection as someone who has symptoms as assessed by a healthcare practitioner, rather than an asymptomatic false positive. Those who promote and have perpetuated this policy should face the courts as soon as possible.  
- **Vaccine-safety and testing:** Simply put there is no emergency and therefore no need to rush a vaccine that nobody needs nor wants. There already exists conventional strategies such as Hydroxychloroquine and zinc, herbal medicine strategies, and nutritional approaches which can help vulnerable persons. A vaccine that has been thoroughly trialled, through long term and independent replication trials, and placebo controlled randomised controlled trials for example using a saline solution rather than another vaccine, may be developed but given the massive conflicts of interest between assorted governments, pharmaceutical interests and Big Tech the current roll-out is clearly an international conspiracy to profit from the misery of others. A disgrace and all persons who have perpetuated this policy should face criminal prosecution as soon as possible.
- **Face masks:** Face masks do not work because they cannot exclude a viral particle which is apparently less than 80 nanometres. Only a solid mask such as the equivalent of a gas mask can do this. The masks are otherwise a health hazard, with the hot and damp atmosphere behind the mask in front of the mouth acting as a magnet for anaerobic bacteria and other infectious agents which have and will cause disease in long term users. Reduced oxygen levels, increased carbon dioxide in the circulation, mask mouth, dental hygiene and the deleterious psychological effects, particularly in the absence of risk assessments which could have been carried out by now, reveals that the purpose of masks is not health but subservience. Those with “exemptions” are persecuted. Those who have put the public at risk by this policy should be held to account.
- **Censorship:** The ongoing use of mass censorship has discredited mainstream media in all its nefarious forms. The complete absence of debate; the callous disregard for science and the hounding of those speaking out and risking their lives and careers is an international disgrace. The public are slowly losing faith in these institutions and they may never recover as a consequence. I certainly hope so. They must face a reckoning for their role in aiding and abetting in this pseudopandemic conspiracy which continues to kill and cause distress for so many innocent people.

I think the Covid19 is the biggest scam ever.  
In South Africa last year 11700 died of normal flu.  
We are now at about 20000 deaths.   
BUT There are no other deaths.  
No TB deaths.  
No co morbidities deaths.  
No heart attacks.   

We have heard that doctors are threatened and bribed to give all deaths  as Covid19.  
I do not accept their treats.

I’ve spent 40 years working in the field of pharmaceutical safety  studies.   
Clinical studies are always bound by the Nuremberg Code of  ethics and the Declaration of Helsinki.  
I believe the UK GOV crossed a  line by circumventing the code which requires long term safety to be  demonstrated by animal testing before a drug is used in humans.   
They are effectively experimenting on the UK population with a completely novel  vaccine.   

Does this amount to treason?
