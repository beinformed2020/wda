**Pfizer and Moderna’s “95% effective” vaccines—let’s be cautious and first see the full data**
Only full transparency and rigorous scrutiny of the data will allow for informed decision making.

> In the United States, all eyes are on  Pfizer and Moderna.  
> The topline efficacy results from their experimental covid-19 vaccine trials are astounding at first glance.  
> Pfizer says it  recorded 170 covid-19 cases (in 44,000 volunteers), with a remarkable  split: 162 in the placebo group versus 8 in the vaccine group.  
> Meanwhile Moderna says 95 of 30,000 volunteers in its ongoing trial got covid-19: 90 on placebo versus 5 receiving the vaccine, leading both companies to claim around 95% efficacy.  
>
> There may be much more complexity to the  “95% effective” announcement than meets the eye—or perhaps not. Only  full transparency and rigorous scrutiny of the data will allow for  informed decision making. The data must be made public.
