The duration of transmissibility of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and the associated level of contagion have been uncertain. We cultured severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in serial respiratory samples obtained from hospitalized patients with Covid-19 to assess the duration of shedding of viable virus.  

The data reported here represent all the patients with Covid-19, as confirmed by positive real-time reverse transcriptaseâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, who were hospitalized at Chung-Ang University Hospital in Seoul, South Korea, between February and June 2020. The Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene) for nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples was used for real-time RT-PCR testing. 1 Patients were isolated until two consecutive negative or inconclusive results on real-time RT-PCR were documented, at least 24 hours apart. 2,3 We endeavored to obtain samples at approximately 2-day intervals, but this was not always possible. Viral RNA was quantitated with the use of the cycle-threshold value for the N gene of SARS-CoV-2.4 Viral cultures were conducted by means of a plaque assay until at least two consecutive cultures showed no growth.
