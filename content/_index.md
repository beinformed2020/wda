# LOCKDOWN. DID IT SAVE LIVES?

### AN INVITATION TO THE MOST IMPORTANT SEMINAR OF YOUR LIFE.

![Did it save lives?](/img/main/LOCKDOWN_BASIC_FLYER.jpg#center)



## WHO ARE WE?

We are an independent non-profit alliance of thousands of doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals and staff around the world who have united in the wake of the Covid-19 response chapter to share experiences with a view to ending all lockdowns and related damaging measures and to re-establish universal health determinance of psychological and physical wellbeing for all humanity.

### AN OPEN LETTER

We the undersigned call upon the government and the people of the United Kingdom to stop all lockdown measures immediately.

We were told initially that the premise for lockdown was to ‘flatten the curve’ and therefore protect the NHS from being overwhelmed. 

It is clear that at no point was the NHS in any danger of being overwhelmed, and since the end of April 2020 covid wards have been largely empty; and crucially the death toll from covid has remained extremely low.

We now have hundreds of thousands of so-called ‘cases’, ‘infections’ and ‘positive tests’ but no sick people. Covid wards have been by and large empty throughout May, June, July, August and September 2020. It is clear therefore that these ‘cases’ are in fact healthy people. So-called asymptomatic cases have never in the history of respiratory disease been the driver for spread of infection. Symptomatic people spread respiratory infections not asymptomatic people. It is now blindingly obvious that the covid pandemic has long since fizzled out, we have reached ‘herd’ immunity and have no need for a vaccine.

We therefore call for an immediate end to all lockdown measures, social distancing, mask wearing, testing of healthy individuals, track and trace, immunity passports, the vaccination program and so on. 

There has been a catalogue of unscientific, non-sensical policies enacted which must never again be repeated. 

- Covid has proved less deadly than previous flu seasons.
- Isolating the healthy has hampered herd immunity.
- Placing the public under virtual house arrest has caused untold damage to both physical and mental health.
- Ventilating instead of oxygenating patients proved to be a deadly policy and an unwarranted failure.
- Sending infected people from hospitals to care homes placed the elderly and frail under reckless risk and resulted in thousands of unlawful deaths.  
- Blanket Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders were imposed on thousands of people without their consent nor the consent of their families – this is both unlawful and immoral and lead to thousands of deaths in care homes.
- Testing healthy individuals is non-sensical and unscientific.
- PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infective.
- The government’s own report estimates that some two hundred thousand (200,000) people will die as a result of lockdown – not the virus. Hospitals being closed, suicide and poverty will result in more deaths than the virus.
- Undue pressure has been applied to doctors to coerce them into putting covid on death certificates – exaggerating the death toll.
- The rules for the signing of death certificates have been changed solely for covid. It now only needs one doctor, not two, to sign. Further, doctors do not even need to have seen the patient in order to sign.
- Autopsies have virtually been banned, no doubt leading to misdiagnosis of cause of deaths; and reducing our understanding of the disease itself.
- Worse still, care home staff who have no medical training are able to give a statement as to the cause of death.
- Professor Neil Ferguson’s modelling which predicted half a million deaths in the UK has been roundly condemned as being not fit for purpose.
- Countries which did not lock down Sweden, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Belarus have all done significantly better than us in terms of percentage of population deaths. They also have intact economies.
- Reports now estimate that as many as seven million (7,000,000) people in the UK will lose their jobs as a result of lockdown. It is well known that poverty directly adversely affects health, we can expect to see many people suffering with poor health as a direct result of lockdown.

Government have taken advantage of the covid episode and have used the media to recklessly increase fear levels in the public. Government have effectively bypassed democracy and have enacted new laws without parliamentary scrutiny and have imposed the most absurd, dystopian rules on society. 

Preventative measures such as vitamins D, C and zinc should have been recommended and the voluntary isolation of the frail - should they so choose; would have been a far better strategy. The rest of society could and should have continued as normal.

Government have acted maliciously in censoring doctors, nurses and NHS staff. The people have the perfect right to hear what is going on in hospitals, and the medical profession have a duty to look after the public and to reassure them. The medical profession have not been allowed to let the public know that covid wards have been empty for months, and this has unnecessarily added to the public’s distress and anxiety.

It has become clear that Public Health England (PHE), World Health Organisation (WHO), Centre for Disease Control (CDC), National institute for Health (NIH) etc have conflicts of interests, as they all accept very large ‘donations’ from the pharmaceutical and vaccine industry. These conflicts of interests have effectively corrupted their integrity. It is also clear that governments are heavily lobbied by the pharmaceutical industry and the vaccine industry, again this has compromised their integrity.

The controversial drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been unfairly smeared, by the WHO, CDC, NIH and the media. However HCQ has very firm support from, amongst others: Professor Harvey Risch epidemiologist from Yale, The American Association of Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), American Frontline Doctors, and Professor Didier Raoult microbiologist and infectious disease specialist - to name but a few. 

The Lancet was forced to retract studies on HCQ after it was revealed by the Guardian newspaper that they had been completely fabricated and written by a sci-fi writer and a porn star. Even following this astounding revelation the WHO still continued it’s ban on the drug. HCQ according to AAPS has a ninety per cent (90%)  cure rate when given early and alongside zinc and they say it is safer than many over the counter drugs such as aspirin. In short if HCQ had been made widely available we would not have had any pandemic! Why was HCQ banned then? Could it be that there are no huge profits to be made from this drug?

Cui bono? Who benefits?

Vaccine manufacturers will make trillions from this, as will track and trace manufacturers, and the pharmaceutical industry stand to make trillions from the testing. Prime minister Boris Johnson announced the new ‘moonbeam’ testing will cost £100 Billion, approximately two thirds of the annual NHS budget. 

Surely these vast sums would be better spent on treating all of the neglected patients who have been left to the wolves during lockdown and who now face huge waiting lists.
