**Executive summary**

\* As late as March 11th, 2020, the UK government and medical officers issued practical and minimally disruptive advice to combat the spread  of the novel coronavirus.

\* On March 16th, the now infamous Neil Ferguson/Imperial College  paper was published predicting over 500,000 deaths in the UK and 2.2  million in the US if suppression measures were not introduced.

\* Stricter measures were announced on the day that paper was  published, and the first UK lockdown was announced a week later, on  March 23rd. US states variously followed suit.

\* The committee that has been advising the government throughout this period is called the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE).  Ferguson was a member of this committee until he resigned in May for  having broken lockdown rules.

\* This week’s note examines the key influencers on SAGE and their conflicts of interest:

– Organisations invested in vaccines make money from vaccines. People who acquire natural immunity have less/no need for a vaccine. If people are locked in their homes, they have less chance of acquiring natural  immunity.

– Twelve out of 20 key influencers work for/have received funding from organisations involved in the Covid-19 vaccine.

– There are four times more modellers/statisticians and experts in  behaviour manipulation on the committee than there are virologists.  There are no immunologists.

\* It doesn’t matter if a drug is good or bad. It matters that those  who have a financial interest in that drug are conflicted if they give  advice that protects the financial interest in that drug.
