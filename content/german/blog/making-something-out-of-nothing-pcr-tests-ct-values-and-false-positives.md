A comment on the efficacy of the RT-PCR test in view of the Jaafar paper. 
SUMMARY: If inoculation can be used as verification of the  Corman-Drosten RT-PCR test for Covid-19, about 50% of the positive  results reported must be considered false when a maximum of 35 cycles  are applied. If only 25 cycles are applied the fraction of false  positives drops to 20%.
